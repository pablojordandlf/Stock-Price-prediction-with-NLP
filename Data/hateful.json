We have reached peak bullshit. https:/", "I typed up a slightly lengthy response to Luis Cuende's latest post about [\"Making Ethereum Great Again\"](https://forum.aragon.org/t/ethdao-making-ethereum-great-again/746) with Aragon's \"EthDAO\" proposal. The [thread it was posted in](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/baz1o5/ethdao_making_ethereum_great_again_aragon/) seems unpopular (for good reason, as I'll try to show), so I've created a separate top-level thread to air out these thoughts for added visibility and also to encourage a bit more discussion.\n\nYes, my tone can be construed as hostile. I find this company deeply offensive to my sensibilities and I don't apologize.\n\n>\"At Aragon One, we care a great deal about our users\"\n\nI have yet to see evidence of that. I think you mean you care about your \"stakeholders\".\n\n>\"Even if we love Ethereum and it was the community that we originated from, we are also looking into Polkadot\"\n\nIn other words, you think it makes sense to join forces with a private permissioned version of the Ethereum ecosystem to hedge your bets against the community that funded your project and made you all filthy rich. That's some fantastic loyalty and integrity right there. What could possibly go wrong by trying to get rich a second time by betraying your base?\n\nAragon's Polkadot play won't actually make \"decentralized organizations widespread\". That's just more inauthentic messaging. Parity's Web3 umbrella will be controlled by a very narrow group of stakeholders with DOT tokens (basically, Gavin Wood and his backers). That renders all inter-blockchain communication dependent on a plutocratic oligarchy. Public blockchains will become increasing centralized through this mechanism as more people use the underlying root chain for coordination. Organizations based on this kind of infrastructure will become vulnerable to all manner of meddling and disruption by the all-powerful DOT-holders. That's not the kind of infrastructure the public will have any legitimate reason to support. Thus, the organizations built atop this infrastructure will never become widespread.\n\n>\"CEO at Aragon One\"\n\nNeed I say more? This is literally an oxymoron.\n\n>\"I am writing this because I deeply care about Ethereum. Also because Aragon holds \\~0.25% of all ETH. I also hold ETH personally. So I\u2019d love for Ethereum to work out #tribalism\"\n\nI have yet to see evidence of that. I think you mean you \"deeply care\" about the riches that were carelessly dropped into your coffers. Also, having a sense of community or loyalty to a cause isn't \"tribalism\". It would be great if you and others stopped abusing this derogatory term to rationalize your own infidelities.\n\n>\"It\u2019s clear that developers are the end user of Ethereum\".\n\nIt's not \"clear\" at all. It's actually false. Developers take advantage of Ethereum in order to reach the end users. It's not complicated. If we expect Ethereum to amount to more than a shallow private club for coders then it needs to serve the interests of the wider public. If you expect any kind of adoption of this technology, then you must target the users first and foremost. The developers are the means to that end. So, you've got it entirely backwards.\n\n>\"the users wouldn\u2019t even notice they are using Ethereum\"\n\nThat's the very same line of thought that led people to start using Facebook and other walled gardens. Fooling people with a friendly and convenient UX doesn't legitimize your underlying tech stack, end-user license agreement, and so on. Enough with these deceptive practices.\n\n>\"The original plan (as heard from Ethereum cofounders) was to migrate the Ethereum Foundation funds into a DAO once the technology was ready. Now it is ready, so I propose that it\u2019s time to do so.\"\n\nThe original plan never identified the governance structure of this DAO. The reason it hasn't happened to this point isn't because of a lack of desire, but because the technology, and the community itself (by which I mean everyone with an interest in Ethereum, not just devs!), are still too immature and inexperienced to produce a viable and legitimate system.\n\nClaiming the Ethereum community is suddenly ready because Aragon has played around with a few corporate toy models is a joke of epic proportions, honestly. Aragon might know how to hack a few things together, but I highly doubt they understand good governance. Good governance in a \"public organization\" context isn't a product. It's a philosophy; or principle-based ideology for decision-making. The technology merely tries to embody this underlying logic. If you have a bad philosophy, you'll end up with bad governance and bad technology. Aragon has a terrible philosophy. In my opinion, it's selfish, corporate capitalism gone wild. Ergo, their approach to governance and technology will be similarly terrible. They admit as much when they say:\n\n>\"we certainly don\u2019t know what\u2019s the best governance mechanism for something like Ethereum\"\n\nAnd yet, they go on to attack the current informal governance process, proposing a \"committee system\" in its place. What's this committee system, you ask? Good question! Supposedly, it'll just be \"how it works today in a transparent manner\". Bullshit, I'm sorry. What Aragon has in mind here is formalized coin voting and little else. They haven't developed any real software to account for people's legitimate reasoning and democratic concerns, which is the only thing saving the current governance process from complete failure and tyranny!\n\nTo be very clear, our ability to voice our concerns and to actually be heard by the community at large, regardless of our perceived \"stake\" and \"status\", is what makes Ethereum governance different from other networks. It's the one saving grace keeping us in a somewhat respectable state. Sacrificing that democratic hope so that the entrenched inner circle of early adopters (the \"stakeholders\") can rule us more effectively is one of the most horrifying mistakes I can imagine.\n\nTLDR; Aragon is a deceptive untrustworthy corporate entity. They're merely using this EthDAO proposal to market their own broken philosophy and broken technology to the rest of us.", "I'm not a programmer but the code for this project has been ruled as shit...

Most of the past soaring crypto prices never  hit a scaling limitation. I think BTC showed us what that looks like in  2017. If we get a bull run soon, it appears (to me) BTC will have full  blocks by 10K and I think that will cause the price to cap out around  20K again. My belief is that it can't keep rising very far with full  blocks. Some might say the inability to send coins during a frenzy will  lead to a supply shortage and that will make the price rise even  faster/higher. What do you think will happen to BTC if it's blocks are  full and a bull run keeps going?\n\nOf course, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has been quietly developing code that  should be able to scale for a major buying frenzy. I don't think it is  ready to scale for full planetary e-cash yet, but, it's team seems to be  more focused on achieving Satoshi's peer-to-peer electronic cash for  the world's people than any other cryptocurrency I know about. If BTC  stalls and the bull continues, I believe BCH could go crazy\u2026 Then it  will probably crash quite a bit (with all the coins) when the frenzy  finishes. I think BCH could end up with a price that equals or exceeds  the BTC price after a bull run if the run is not stopped to save BTC.\n\nAm I mistaken about something?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom: [https://honest.cash/Big\\_Bubbler/is-speculative-upside-limited-by-how-many-people-can-buy-during-a-buying-frenzy-3455](https://honest.cash/Big_Bubbler/is-speculative-upside-limited-by-how-many-people-can-buy-during-a-buying-frenzy-3455)\n\n&#x200B;", "@RepAdamSchiff Adam look at the shit in your own back yard.\nStand up and work across the aisle to fix our terrible https://t.co/NNo7vUPI2q", "RT @TUOwlsDaily: We're @_Kleindaddy_ (Adam Klien) (71) days from the #CFB season the true freshman  Offensive Lineman in 2018 , and he star", "RT @MotherCabriniNY: Whatta utter crock of shit on behalf of $FB.\n\nAnd Wall Street continues to think $OSTK crypto/blockchain VC portfolio", "preach that shit boy", "@CryptoCobain Journalist are just producing shit.

Useful. \nA lot more people currently need crypto for trustless, secure, global payments, than for buying their morning coffee. BTC is ~20x more secure than BCH, which a lot of people clearly think, 2 years later, is worth paying substantially higher fees for.\nCash, Paypal and Visa already exist.\n\n4.

In fact the last time BCH was spam \"attacked\" was when the block limit was 8 MB and as far as I am aware not a single transaction was delayed due to this supposed \"attack\". After the block size limit was increased to 32 MB there has only been one occasion where blocks were nearly filled and this was due to a community driven stress test.\n\nI don't believe that larger block size limit will cause more spam. The evidence so far is that a larger block size limit results in less spam. Increasing the block size makes spam attacks less effective, not more effective.\n\nr/bitcoin unfortunately is just full of bullshit. They use that subreddit to push the small block narrative and to promote Blockstream products. Most of us have been banned from commenting there.

I abided by the rules. I didn't shill anything. I didn't spam. I didn't troll. I made comments every now and then, usually when I disagreed with someone. (For me comments that do nothing other than agree, unless they add something novel are pretty pointless). I can only conclude I was banned for disagreement, aka wrong-think. Doesn't surprise me one bit to be honest, but it seems that it's not very hard to get banned from that group. I was being careful, but apparently not careful enough. Just disagree with the official narrative about any topic and you are running a huge risk of being banned, it seems.\n\nSo why does this kind of thing happen? I think it's one of two main causes. The moderators get pleasure from it, which pretty much sums up everything you need to know about the moderators, or, it's because the group cannot survive questioning and it cannot survive criticism. If it espoused ideas that could withstand scrutiny, then it would welcome challenges to the narrative. Each time the narrative stood up to criticism, the group would get stronger since people would learn through exploration of ideas. Yet, we have the exact opposite thing occurring. Any time someone disagrees with something or challenges something, they must be removed from the group. The group cannot be exposed to different ideas else it would collapse. That is a significant sign of weakness. Mark my words, *BTC* will fail.\n\nINB4: Yes, yes, I know the moderators can do what they like.

This happened August 1st 2017.\n\nThe fork was pretty much 3 things: segwit removal, 8 mb blocks and an EDA algo so that bitmain could game the PoW difficulty and profit from it. Quick obs in this connection: a true fork would leave the difficulty untouched so miners would need to choose organically.\n\nThe flippening attempt happened during october 2017 for those who forgot. Don't you think that wasn't dangerous, because it was dangerous. IIRC BTC fell from ~8k to ~5k and BCH went from sub ~1k to ~2.5K.\n\nNow recall that segwit2x was cancelled on **November** 8th 2017, way after RV was behind BCH and after the flippening attempt through market pump happened. \n\nHere are some links: way before segwit2x was scheduled to happen, and right after BCH forked, [Roger Ver was already supporting BCH as early as August 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkbSrmsYJ9c&t=2647s). And [RV started openly promoting BCH since September 2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/72bknj/bitcoincom_is_now_promoting_bitcoin_cash_at_all/).\n\nSo, what was segwit2x? In my personal opinion, it is was a futures market scam. They sold the futures and cancelled, so that a lot of people lost ALL the money and they made a fortune.\n\nNow, things simply don't add up: flippening attempt and BCH support **before** segwit2x, but in social media the biggest support base from the big blockers was for segwit2x? Segwit is like the plague in rBTC, the most horrible thing in the world, but they were fully supporting Segwit2x, which is obviously segwit but with a small block increase (not even close to the 100 meg blocks RV is saying are needed to save the BABies hum?)\n\nAre you smelling the bullshit already?\n\nNow take a look at what notorious rBTC shills are saying: https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/bgwh9t/freetrader_who_wrote_the_intial_bitcoin_cash/eloa15l/\n\nThey are trying to downplay what in my opinion was a very clear futures market scam run by RV (+ very likely Vorhees and others behind the cancellation).\n\n**I think this is important for the bitcoin community as a whole.** They are lying straight-face that RV just magically happened to find BCH fork, think it was very cool and that it would \"save the BABies\", and that AFTER segwit2x was cancelled RV went full BCH and started to hate segwit. **This is provably a lie according to the links above.**\n\n\n***\n\nWhy all of this happened? Now it comes the second, and most important, part: bitmain tried an IPO heist in HK. Their valuation model was clear: an huge bag of overpriced BCH that would be indirectly dumped onto the IPO investors by collecting money from stock sales priced on inflated BCH. They knew their books were cooked and embezzled by overpriced crypto holdings. \n\nOverpriced how? One simple way (not saying this was the scam, but possibly): give S9 to big miners in exchange of tons of BCH fork coins, price that back in retail S9 price.\n\nOn March 26, 2019, [Bitmain lost their IPO](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitmains-ipo-filing-has-expired/). Now ask yourself: what those coins became? They became **liabilities**. Ask yourself another thing: when did the last BAB pump happened? Weeks prior to their IPO loss. Coincidence?\n\nNow let's see the final hallmark of a scam, which is tech: BAB is implementing the schnorr-without-benefits fork in May, which is copy&paste of blockstream work. None of the shilled ABC roadmap has been delivered so far. What BAB has now is: a few parameters changed to increase max block to 32 MB (anyone can do); cashAddr which is pretty much bad UX with no benefits (anyone can do, it is just a stupid mask); CTOR that yields nothing without the rest of their promised vaporware, and with it the marginal improvement is negligible anyway; another DAA algo because the marvelous devs realized their previous EDA would make them even more susceptible to a 51% attack (if you cannot flip, you can be flipped, simple).\n\nThe cherry on the top is rolling checkpoints, implemented unilaterally without consensus: a rolling checkpoint is simply a bunch of colluded miners agreeing to follow each other's mined blocks at height x-11. **That's really what this is**, but disguised as an \"anti-reorg feature\". Guess what, any centralized shitcoin has the same \"anti-reorg feature\", right?\n\nIn sum: BCH was used for a series of clear scams, some of which worked very well (segwit2x cancellation scam), some of which failed (IPO attempt) and some of which were a win-win game (flippening attempt failing, insiders dumped; coinbase surprise listing, insiders dumped). \n\nIt is definitely [dishonestly marketed](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ay4nu3/north_queenslandaustralia_bch_adoption_may_be_a/). RV is only interested in peddling scams like an [ICO with 70% premine not even launched in his marvelous BCH token platform](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/auj9jx/im_now_an_official_advisor_for_livenpay_a_food/). Not long ago RV was also shilling BSV, [believe it or not!!!](https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/1090981547144994816).\n\nI know this sub doesn't buy into rBTC, RV or bitmain's crap, but it doesn't hurt leaving a remainder here.

The low volatility at this point has allowed us to maintain the same analysis on the state of crypto for about a week. \n\nThe support holding from $3330-3400 still remains a crucial level. A break would could result in revisiting 2018-2019 lows. \n\n$3500 has turned into local resistance. A significant close, above $3500, (4hr. Or higher time frame) will have us reevaluate our 75% fiat 25% crypto portfolio allocation.\n\nIn other news, QuadrigaCX, a Canadian digital asset exchange, reportedly owes its customers roughly 190 million USD and has lost access to a majority of these funds!\n\nQuadriga stored a vast amount of the cryptocurrency on their exchange in cold wallets offline. Unfortunately, the only person with access to the offline, secured funds, is the late CEO for Quadriga, Gerald Cotten who passed away in December of 2018.\n\nIt has become apparent to the team that after the CEO\u2019s death, they have now lost the ability to access the locked funds. Cotten took sole responsibility for securing the crypto funds and now that he has passed, any attempt by third parties to extract the data and unlock his personal computer have been unsuccessful.\n\nOur team feels awful for all parties involved as it does not seem that foul play has occurred, but rather a very misfortunate circumstance. \n\nThat being said, we have to question the protocol in place, for QuadrigaCX, as now they have essentially locked away a significant amount of their clients\u2019 money due to faulty security measures. \n\nThis is exactly why we have always preached holding one\u2019s own private keys, personally, and giving trusted family members or loved ones the back up keys needed to access funds in the event of illness or death. Just like in traditional wealth storage, even respected institutions can still ultimately mishandle/mismanage one\u2019s capital which can result in losses like the QuadrigaCX situation. \n\nOne of the most important aspects of this space is the ability to personally protect one\u2019s wealth to the highest capacity, and always remain in control of your funds.

This is diluting the value of cryptos into smaller more fragile segments. I'm confident that in the end there will not be room for over 2000 coins being successful. What if we instead join forces by devising a plan to merge together the value from multiple chains under a single roof. This could be BCH as it has merit in scaling and having well tested economical incentives etc., but I'm not ruling out other possibilities at this point. I know there would be technical challenges and economical implications, and I don't even know if there is a solution that can be implemented, but I can't seem to shrug off this idea. I imagine a merger would lock the relative values of the coins merging at a specific block, and one of the chains would ideally stop being worked upon. All holders of coins on both chains would then transact on the same chain. I imagine no one would accept inflation, and therefore in case of merging into BCH the 21M cap should remain.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge Ethereum was built on it's own chain because if was not feasible to build on BTC, but does it hold true for BCH?\n\nHow about Litecoin, Dash, Zcoin and others.

If you look, you can find them under $1000 on sale, or about $500-600 used.\n\nDefibrillators are much more complicated than simple EKG machines. They aren\u2019t simply measuring an electric signal, they are analyzing complex rhythms. Some deadly rhythms look remarkably similar to no deadly ones, and shocking the wrong rhythm could be lethal. Additionally some rhythms need to be shocked at very specific times in the heartbeat cycle or again could propagate an even deadlier rhythm.

I would estimate your materials cost wouldn\u2019t be cheap either.\n\nI practice emergency medicine. I actually recommended against my mother buying one of these devices. In the right situation, they are absolutely lifesaving. That said, probably only 10-20% of cardiac arrests that I see present in a rhythm that is shockable. I know if my dad ever suffered a cardiac arrest, she would spend a ton of time fumbling around trying to set up the AED, instead of focusing providing good quality CPR while waiting for EMS. Even though AEDs are getting better, they can still be confusing for a non-medical person to use. I would much rather someone get good CPR for 5 minutes or so, then no CPR and maybe a 10-20% chance of a shock fixing them. Cardiac arrests run by trained professionals can sometimes be a shit show to watch. Despite the claims, I cannot imaging a non-medical person trying to do CPR and use an AED in a time efficient way, especially in a solo situation.

I was an early adapter of Ethereum, and then ETC.  I am the author of the now infamous \"ragequit\" [www.EtcIsComing.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20171208041655/http:/www.etciscoming.com/).\n\nBecause of my observations and investigations of what happeed during the Ethereum DAO, and the subsequent fact that I have ever see evidence that Vitalik and Co ever learned their lessons.... I won't touch Ethereum.  The ragequit speaks for itself, and the ETC community suffered from the same issue....\n\n..... and that issue was twofold:\n\n* Cryptocurrency is MONEY, and the developers creating these blockchain platforms have a fiduciary responsibility to the investors/holders/users.  The Ethereum / ETC developers did NOT show any evidence that they understood that concept, and indeed they continue to come across as immature children in their understanding sometimes of the term \"Fiduciary Responsibility\".  \n\n* Second, Blockchains that include Smart Contract capabilities have a 1000x responsibility to make sure they get it right.  The lessons learned from the multitude of hacks, errors, bugs, and just flat out screw ups caused by \"move fast and break things\" philosophy demands a slow, methodical approach.... such as has been taken by IOHK/Cardano Team.\n\nThe ultimate \"Concept\" of Cardano is not really much different from Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, EOS, or some of the others.  The difference to ME, as an investor, is in the Team and it's Leadership.  It is in the Approach being taken.  Charles Hoskinson is a calm, steady, and reasonably wise hand at the steering wheel.  \n\nBUT..... Charles Hoskinson is not without flaws, and his largest flaw is somewhat entangled with a principle of simple reality..... that this IS New Technology, and so the development will not always be charted in a smooth predictable and linear curve, free from hiccups or unexpected obstacles.  And that development costs money.  Lots of money.\n\nAnd people need to understand that that \"Money\" is currently coming from the early supply of ADA that was basically \"premined\" and the price fluctuations that occur as that monetary supply is \"cashed out\" to pay for development.\n\nI UNDERSTAND THIS CONCEPT, and it has been part of my investing calculation.  BUT last year this time, in the spring of 2018, the projections were being unreasonably hyped.  And those \"in-the-know\", and by that I mean Charles and other insiders, knew damn well that the hype was ahead of the price, and they subsequently took advantage of that and took out development funding.  This actually happened across most blockchains.  \n\nAs an investor I have always been aware that in part this is the reality, and that my investments (purchases of bags of ADA) will fund the development.  Because I believe in the leadership of this project more than the leadership of other projects - these expected hype/selloff phases do not bother me because it is a part of the reality of funding the development - and ultimately in time my investment will pay off quite dramatically.  Since I am in at under 2 cents, it already is.  \n\nWith that said, there is an expected reasonable limitation to this stretching of the \"fiduciary relationship\".  I feel that this is being stretched a bit too far again lately.  I definitely felt that last Spring and early summer the \"hints of promises\" coming from IOHK/Charles was beyond reasonable.  I can imagine that if I was in at 70 cents to a dollar I would feel quite betrayed right now.\n\nI think the recent hype leading up to the Summit was also a coordinated stretch to most likely take some off the table to fund more development.  \n\nI am still 100% committed to this project, but let me make it clear that this is primarily because at sub 2 cents/ada my bags are exceptionally light in holding costs - but weighty in terms of volume I am holding.  Suffice it to say I am in the top investor class.\n\nSo let me conclude this.... Charles, I believe in your vision and think your leadership is a steady hand in a technology I think is getting closer and closer to \"Moon\" so to speak.  And by \"Moon\", I mean actual use case adoption.  Unlike others, I see \"Moon\" as simply a by-product of a succesful product.\n\nWith that said, we've now had at least two intentionally promoted \"fake moon shots\" here.  While I understand the financial reality of development funding needs.... I suggest that we don't see any more of this behavior.\n\nKeep up the good work.  Work on improving honest and open communication.\n\nThat's all.", "What the shit is this? https://t.co/kRemdM65X2 May 25, 2019 at 08:07PM #CryptoCurrency", "He should be kicked out can't even do his job on his hate @realDonaldTrump mission someone should check his bank re https://t.co/CksrV1asPF", "So Adam is back, which means Billy continues to hate on him for Delia even though his pathetic ass is the one that https://t.co/y9E1R8eXqA", "This Awful Bitcoin Stat Guarantees Its Not Cryptos Future: Mathematician https://t.co/ITGSD11gha #bitcoin #crypto https://t.co/PTOVjWvCe3", "Nipsey hussle was spreading knowledge about blockchain how to disrupt the government they hated that shit", "CT is screaming for global #crypto adoption, yet most of us know when shit hits the fan and the neighbour is gonna https://t.co/AGbxfSvZcb", "The difference between inflation and deflation...\n\n https://t.co/uWAUQK9u1U \n\nRegister Now &amp; Start Buying &amp; Sell https://t.co/Nkz5zxXgkJ", "@cz_binance Bitcoin ethereum and blockchain is shit \n\nIts useless in the real world and does not have any meaning o https://t.co/nUZD0TCR8Q", "@RichCimini Bill Belichick somehow was entrusted with an awful lot of power right  from the start in New England, b https://t.co/UvffrnKOHy", "Looks like UK and US might not allow him to live long enough for a trial.

Please search here and read the *extensive* , *exhaustive* comments we've made on the subject. \n\nSome highlights:\n\n- All other coins (bitcoin, litecoin, etc) are inflating more than dogecoin, and will for many years to come, until they are mined out.\n\n- Rarity does not guarantee a value increase.  Rarity is often correllated with price, it does not, however, dictate it; if it did, 42coin would be priceless. It isn't.\n\n- The percentage of dogecoin inflation effectively goes down every year as the coin number is constant and the existing supply increases; this means the added coins in terms of percent, diminish.\n\n- The rate of wallet loss and coin loss, which is not insignificant, significantly lowers the effective inflation rate.\n\n- Functional currencies need inflation to operate; Dogecoin is not a get-rich-quick scheme, it isn't a speculative instrument, and artificially trying to pump the price (which a cap will likely be completely ineffective at) will likely just increase volatility.\n\n- The inflation is only a factor for people who do not dig below the surface; as it is not of high significance as a price driver in anything but a psychological fashion. While you may want this psychological factor to be removed so that the value of your holdings increase, there is absolutely no guarantee that it would 'do the trick', just so that a few people could cash out - and is likely to do more harm than good.\n\nAnd lastly:\n\n- Anyone who disagrees with the inflation is free to fork the coin and cap it; and that fork is free to travel in value on its own merit.

However, price inflation in pretty much evey other category runs 5-6% per annum, that includes energy, land, college tuition, aggregate tax receipts, etc. The main reason governments are keeping rates low is to keep interest payments on existing debt manageable.

What HAS taken off is the use of blockchain technology as a solution to corporate challenges. Specifically, Ethereum and its tokens are being invested into by corporations. Bitcoin still exists because it has the brand-name, and people who are investing for the first time will gravitate towards Bitcoin. \n\nI just don't see a place for Litecoin in the future, not as a method of payment, not as a store of value, not as an investment, not as a technology.\n\nThat being said, I still haven't realized my 19x gains...", "New #Exchange to you\n\nYOBIT\n\nBEST ALT &amp; SHIT COINS \n\nSignUp   https://t.co/dCSGpfAoek \n\n#Airdrop https://t.co/LhTXljOmnG", "RT @crusaderl8: I really believed in these guys but they turned into scum of the earth.

A non-inflationary currency is ideal for store of value, whereas an inflationary currency is ideal as a medium of exchange.\n\nAlternatively, one could propose a negative interest currency (or demourage) similar to what Silvio Gesell proposed with *freigeld*. But the outcome is to some degree the same (though i strongly believe Gesell's solution is the better one); your money will lose value over time. Today even the IMF is arguing in favor of a negative interest economy to stimulate the circulation of money. And we have to remember that money circulation is a critical component for an economy to function.\n\nHere, Gesell comments on the power imbalance between buyer and seller (i.e. money that doesn't lose value over time vs. goods that do):\n\n*\"The possessor of money, by the very nature of the money-material (precious metal or paper) is exempt from such loss. in commerce, therefore, the capitalist (possessor of money) can always afford to wait, whereas the possessors of merchandise are always hurried. So if the negotiations about the price break down, the resulting loss invariably falls on the possessor of goods, that is, ultimately, on the worker (in the widest sense). This circumstance is made use of by the capitalist to exert pressure on the possessor of goods (worker), and to force him to sell his product below the true price.\"*\n\nand,\n\n*\"By the selection of gold as money-material, the buyer has been allowed time to choose the most favourable moment for the purchase of goods, and in granting this freedom the devisers of the gold standard forgot that the seller would be forced to wait patiently in the market till the buyer chose to appear. Through the choice of the money-material, demand for goods was placed at the discretion of the owners of money and delivered up to be the sport of caprice, greed, speculation and chance*.\u00a0\"  \n\n\nTherefore,  \n\n\n*\"If money is not to hold sway over goods, it must deteriorate, as they do. Let it be attacked by moth and rust, let it sicken, let it run away; and when it comes to die let its possessor pay to have the carcass flayed and buried. Then, and not till then, shall we be able to say that money and goods are on an equal footing and perfect equivalents\"*", "@Beautyon_ Cant wait to meme the shit out of Peter.

Developed countries have no incentive to issue the national digital cash, and the United States, Canada and North America have no intention to issue it.\n\nTherefore, in the future, the issue of national currency will only be an attempt by some countries, which is a direction for the exploration of block chain technology and will not become a popular trend, nor will it replace the status of national legal currency.\n\nUnder such a trend, a\u00a0country\u00a0which with speedy\u00a0development of encryption technology deserves our attention.

I've expanded on it a bit and shared it here in-case it is of value to some others.\n\n## My Reply\n\nI haven't read the full article, but the answer to just your question is: yes. BCH probably wouldn't allow you to store a transaction offline or 50 years.\n\n**However**: I personally have never felt comfortable with the idea of storing a tx offline anyway and I have never suggested others should do so. I think it's quite reasonable to assume the protocol may change at some point invaliding some old, offline (not committed to the chain) transactions because of things like:\n\n* a cryptographic algorithm used by Bitcoin (BCH) being broken and thus needing to be replaced. A balance being spent by an offline tx in this scenario could either become vulnerable to being spent by an attacker or could become invalidated after a grace period has passed to avoid a sudden massive period of currency, monetary inflation that occurs when a miner sweeps up a large amount of vulnerable funds which were not moved from accounts (UTXOs) which were known to be vulnerable.\n* a large change being made to how transactions are constructed in order to allow Bitcoin to scale better to fulfil the monetary, transaction demands of the people of the world.\n\nAlso: many of the reasons a person might want to keep a tx offline, can be solved using an on-chain transaction which makes use of advanced scripting features. BCH has actually had a new op code added called something like check-data-sig-verify, that allows you to commit a tx to the chain, but you can only spend it if you create a specially crafted transaction which contains some very specific signed data. This specific op code feature can be used to solve many of the problems previously \"solved\" by keeping offline transactions.\n\nCSW often speaks truth, but he delivers with it a poisoned payload.\n\nIt is my personal opinion that the agenda of CSW is to destroy the Bitcoin project by going in the extreme opposite direction that the Bitcoin Core guys went. IE instead of tiny, floppy-disk style blocks, BSv is directed towards having absurdly and impractically large blocks to the point where people are literally backing up their data to the blockchain. Instead of highly distributed mining, BSv is directed towards having a small number of super nodes. Instead of the anti-business almost communist style attitude that many Bitcoin Core cult members have, CSW & Co appear to have positioned themselves at the extreme polar opposite of the rainbow spectrum and decided to take a pro-mega-corporation attitude where the small business owner who doesn't get involved in crony capitalism, legal domination (through patents and other aggressive legal infrastructure), and doesn't desire to conquer the world has little chance at competing.\n\nAs with many things in life the answer lies in the green part of the rainbow spectrum; somewhere in the middle where a wise person takes the best of both sides and never leans so far to one side that they fall over. \n\nI think BCH is a little closer to the middle than either BTC or BSv.\n\nCSW also seems obsessed with arbitrary, legal compliance. \"Arbitrary\" because he is selecting the arbitrary rules of arbitrary governments which he wishes to help impose on \"Bitcoin\" users. In particular, for some reason he is very focused on gambling & money laundering. Especially strange when you consider he claims to have been involved in the gambling industry in the past (IIRC) and he has been accused by the Australian government of fraud. I'm not saying that Australian government are correct or right. It's just odd that he seems so in favour of arbitrary, government restrictions when he has been targeted by them himself.\n\nHaving said all that, I wish I could simply say that BCH is the future and the one clear path to economic sovereignty! Sadly I no longer believe that. At least not for now. BCH, BTC and BSv all have one thing in common. They are kingdoms.\n\n* BTC is ruled by Bitcoin Core and ultimately has Greg Maxwell at the throne. At least: Greg is the front man.\n* BSv is ruled by nChain/Bitcoin SV and ultimately has CSW at the throne. At least: CSW is the front man.\n* BCH appears to currently be ruled by Bitcoin ABC and ultimately has deadalnix at the throne, as he is the lead developer of the project, has commit rights and is the public face of the project.\n\nUnlike with BTC and BSv, I **don't** think BCH has a dark, hidden hand behind it that is attempting to direct us towards failure to achieve the original vision of Bitcoin. I think it is merely misguidedness & human ego which has led to Bitcoin ABC taking up this very vulnerable position. It's not even just their fault. The miners do not know their own sovereignty and the role they are supposed to play in order to make Bitcoin a truly permissionless, decentralized, censorship resistant, p2p electronic cash system. We (as economic users of BCH and as miners) have even been offered [a path](https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/blob/dev/doc/bip135-guide.md) towards decentralized governance by Bitcoin Unlimited. So far it seems \"we\" have chosen not to take it. \n\nWhen the vulnerable central point of power within BCH is eventually co-opted by outside forces, the failure of the Bitcoin project will not be on Bitcoin ABC; it will be on us.\n\nIf it seems like I am repeating this last point over and over, it's because I am. I see nothing more important than this issue.  This issue is...\n\n* more important than how we order transactions (CTOR vs TTOR vs LORDZOR vs WOODSAW)\n* It's more important than exactly how Bitcoin scales (paraphrasing what Gavin Andresen said: don't let far-in-the-future, potential problems stop us from solving present day problems. Let's keep moving towards success (p2p cash) and we'll solve the real problems as we get to them or get close to them. He also said something like \"don't let perfect be the enemy of good enough\". That guy is a wise man). \n* This issue is more important than what stupid shit the Bitcoin Core cult members are repeating or who CSW is currently suing. \n\nIf Bitcoin (BCH) has a single, centralized point of officialdom, it **will** be attacked. Anyone who is even vaguely awake, slightly knowledgeable of how the current fiat money systems works and mildly aware of the history of BTC will **know** what I just said to be true.\n\nGood luck to you.", "Get this shit off of here.", "@ErikVoorhees @real_vijay Eth is shit coin.. the founders like vitalik mf buterin get a lot of free coin on the onset when it started", "RT @musickazoo: Highlights from Day 1 with @itsloveuasshole \n\nHer: if I see merch of Melissa I will shit. \n\nUs saying Adam at the same time", "I am PMSing so hard and hate everyone and everything and have been on the verge of tears but Richard has been so un https://t.co/XiSldTyMfZ", "i think people SHOULD know when thor outlives everyone from earth 616 and restores the rotten planet he creates gay https://t.co/4QTkOkTpcZ", "RT @Casual__Crypto: (1/2) #venezuela #inflation is so bad money is just left in the streets. \nRemember Germany post WWI? \n\nKids were PLAYIN", "RT @GodneyIsBritney: sis if you remember just luv me ft justin bieber in 2016 then yall know this is bullshit  https://t.co/l8jq1a5vx7", "I have a horrible feeling that we'll bring Odubel back and then he'll proceed to steal playing time from guys such https://t.co/xXnYeQ7Tyz", "RT @cryptopigmedia: There are many and many people that hate Justin Sun.

Why do we need the mining/staking rewards when we have the transaction/gas fees? So my thoughts are this: essentially mining/staking are the same as fees that are paid by hodlers via inflation. Every time new ether is mined, value is decreased in ether as a whole and goes to whoever mined it. So if we removed mining/staking rewards couldn't the nodes just increase the minimum fee needed to transact on the blockchain? They would then come to fair fee via competition and mining rewards wouldn't even play a role.  \n\n\nI'm pretty sure i'm missing something, as this is too simple that others haven't thought about it, so i'm curious what i'm missing.", "Like it or hate it...

For a lot of investors this would be a lot easier to stomach if the entire market was following suit but that clearly isn't the case. A year ago .005 was seen as a gift of a price for those who didn't buy in at the ICO. Now .005 seems fairly overvalued as many price projections have fallen to more realistic levels of .01 to 02 cents being the new ATH's within the next year or so, instead of .20 cents or even a dollar. Personally, If we are going to continue this trend I would like to see a bottom of .0035. That way I can really load up with a lot less capital and put this project on the back burner until the next bitcoin halving and see where the price at that time. Electroneum is sitting on a ton of cash and they aren't known for wasting money, so I'm not worried about them dying off anytime soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDespite all of the real world work towards mass adoption that's being put into this coin, for whatever reason, people just seem to like it at all. Whether you like to admit it or not YouTubers have A LOT of sway when it comes to certain coins and almost all of the top dogs aren't shy about writing Electroneum off whenever a community members brings them up. Of course general ignorance plays a big part into this as well. Where you have folks who didn't buy bitcoin at $3k but won't hesitate to take out a loan to buy it once it surpasses $13k. Then there's the KYC aspect, of which most people will learn, KYC is apart of ETN but may never realize that it can easily be circumvented with the use of paper wallets. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEither way, I think for a lot of people they are at a crossroads with ETN. For those who bought in over a penny they may feel as though they should just cut their losses short and just move on and try their best not be bitter and shit on the project like many others have. Or for those like me, who had the chance to load up in at ICO prices, they may be tempted to sell ETN now before it goes any lower so they can take advantage of other opportunities out there and potentially just buy back their positions 3-6 months from now or whenever. Point is, it would just suck to see your money either slowing diminishing or just not turning over any profit at all over the course of a year plus. A year is simply too long to wait in crypto to be completely honest. Especially, as you become more aware of other opportunities that are extremely lucrative and often transpire within day or weeks at a time. And often times these other project aren't nearly as put together and transparent as ETN, which only adds insult to injury.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not trying to shill here but a perfect example for me would be COVA. Despite the uphill battle that it has as being just another new smart contract, all of that really doesn't matter when you look at the amount of money being thrown at it. Ivy league founded, huge daily volumes, venture capital backing by some of THE biggest players  in the crypto space, coupled with the fact that it's basically brand new token so the price is super low, with so much upside potential in terms of further exchange listing and so on. Long story short, I made more off that coin in one month than some people make in a year. And this was just off of two weeks of worth of due diligence and research. That's what I was looking to do with Electroneum but unfortunately, I was wrong. Not surprisingly either, as that was one of my first coins I learned about. Fast forward a over year later and looking at crypto every single day, I've gotten a lot better at following where \"the money\" is going so it's becoming a lot harder for me to remain loyal to a coin that isn't doing anything for me when when I know there are other potentially life changing opportunities elsewhere.", "@Chinchillazllla It's also awful for the mountain.

Fee redistribution must be the single best argument for holding XLM over other cryptos where fees are burned.", "The most obvious thing being missed here is our favorite word again; Decentralization\n\nBitcoin suffers from the problem of being mined on niche hardware that is produced by a small number of manufacturers, who have the ability to hoard that hashpower until they need a lot of instant capital (ie sell the hardware, under the guise of a 'production run'.\nThe result of this being, the power to control the mining and therefore the transactions, falls into the clutches of those hardware manufacturers. -Centralization.\n\n\nHashrate overall is a useless metric without knowing many things,\n\nNumber of people mining, and their hardware location on earth - if there are enough miners spread across the globe, that is some insurance policy against countrywide, bans/internet outage/natural disaster.\n\nIf there are pools or even mining conglomerates that own big % of the hashrate, or if there are entities that may combine in the future.\n\nIf the algorithm is possible to be mined faster on specialist hardware; as we've seen over the past few years for xmr, new actors will take advantage of this and create themselves ASICs, a very quick way to steal big hashpower with less electrical cost. \n\nAnd following on from that, if there are state level actors with enough compute power to 51% the coin for a sustained period. This is one situation that most people(normies) cant seem to wrap their heads around for 'why cryptocoins have to use so much electricity'. Its to protect the currency from rich fuckers that seek to destroy these more fair currencies that undermine their bullshit fiat currencies that they control and inflate, if normal people actually understood the way money works then maybe you wouldnt see these moronic reddit posts so often.\n\nTo conclude; there is no one metric to which you can attribute the security of a crypto, least the hashrate. Id say the most prevalent is \"optional compute power\" - hashrate that isnt being used right now but the owners have the ability to switch it on at their discretion. To us peons that is on such a scale beyond anything we can accomlish on our own, thus the need for such a level of decentralization in all aspects of the one true cryptocurrency (for now), Monero.", "@RudyHavenstein if anything inflation is miscalculated so its distorting the entire issue regarding fiat money", "@WellsFargo you are the worst bank in existence.

We're not making smart use of block space, so we're likely to experience a bumpy fee ride until people adjust their behavior. It's human nature to want to deny unpleasant truths, but it's better to be ready. Here's what you need to know\ud83d\udc47\n\nIt costs miners virtually nothing to add a transaction. Block space is given to the highest bidder - if nobody bids, it's practically free. If you think mass replicated immutable blockchain data is at least worth something, then it logically follows that blocks WILL be full.\n\nFull blocks mean transactions will actually cost something, and that's needed. Not only does it replace the block reward, but Bitcoin's censorship resistance depends on it: a censoring 51% attacker gets the FULL block reward, but NONE of the transaction fees it censors.\n\nWallets need to get smarter. Fee estimates aim for the next block by default. The result? A bidding war. Better to use Replace-By-Fee (RBF) + under-bidding and automated fee bumps to get a cheaper confirmation within a user-defined time limit. This smooths out the fees.\n\nUpcoming changes like Schnorr, Taproot, MAST, MuSig & SigAgg significantly reduce transaction sizes, but will take a long time to safely get introduced into Bitcoin and require significant changes to wallets in order to support the interactivity required for MuSig & SigAgg.\n\nAre you sending coins between exchanges? Centralized services can settle through federated sidechains. @Blockstream built an entire service for this (Liquid) - we need more of these. Any transactions that don't require strong censorship resistance can use sidechains instead.\n\nLightning + Channel Factories, especially when combined with eltoo, provide a powerful way to minimize on-chain transactions without losing trustlessness. Statechains are another method which sits between Lightning and sidechains in terms of security: [ELI5/15/25/FAQ for Statechains: Off-chain Transfer of UTXO Ownership](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9nhjea/eli51525faq_for_statechains_offchain_transfer_of/)\n\nOne caveat: all off-chain solutions, whether it's third party services or Lightning, do NOT make you immune to on-chain fees. When there are issues, people have to go back on-chain. If you can't afford to pay the fee, you are stuck and won't be able to exit from misbehavior.\n\nDoes this sound complex? It is. There's simply no other way for Bitcoin to stay trustless. If you personally don't need trustlessness, you can always transact cheaply off-chain via third parties. But if we sacrifice trustlessness on the base layer, it'll be gone forever...\ud83d\ude1e", "@NBCTheVoice @marijones @anthonyortiz @lauvsongs Not the best song choice, awful outfit on Anthony.

I expect we will have quite a few people searching the net in the coming months / years as they study up on what all this stuff is. With the rise of state surveillance of blockchain transactions, the need for a truly free and private decentralized system will be more important than ever. I hope this bit of info helps you understand why XMR stands out among the rest of the blockchains today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI now exclusively only use XMR.  The fees are much cheaper than BTC for moving money around daily and its much more private. It is the only crypto that truly behaves like cash notes.   Monero uses different and stronger privacy methods in comparison to all the other privacy coins. It also uses a different Elliptic-curve than all of them. For example, BTC/ZEC/DASH all use secp256k1. It was created by the NSA. Monero uses an Elliptic-curve called edwards25519. ed25519 was created by the academic community and has been reviewed extensively from cryptographers for over 10 years and is widely deployed in the real world. I find it quite odd that Bitcoin was the first known application to use secp256k1.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMonero is much like Bitcoin was when it first began. No one owns or controls Monero. Its mining is currently more decentralized than Bitcoin. It has no centralized miners in China due to ASIC mining. Even the name Monero itself is from a decentralized language known as Esperanto.\n\nHow is Esperanto a \"decentralized language\", how is it similar to a decentralized currency ?\n\n* No country of reference\n* No central authority (there is an academy of Esperanto, a group of people who communicate and educate)\n* The possibility to cross ALL the borders of the world.\n* An agreed upon protocol. You can do minor changes and soft forks, but Esperanto's core is so well written you will have a hard time enhancing it. (Still there was a \"hard fork\" in 1907, but failed eventually)\n* The profound idea that we should all be able to interact without relying on some national authority (like I'm doing right now using the English language).\n\nEsperanto the language was created from scratch just like Moneros protocol. The language is closely related to many of the Romance languages. This is one reason I love Monero. I think psychologically it will appeal to a wider range of people around Earth. For example, these are the proportions of lexemes that are common to Esperanto and other languages: 91.64 percent French; 89.50 percent English; 89.12 percent Italian; 87.79 percent Portuguese; 87.12 percent Spanish; 81.70 percent German; 64.78 percent Latin; 53.26 percent Russian. There are Esperanto speakers in places you would never expect in every corner of the planet from China, India all the way to Africa. Esperanto was created in the late 1870s and early 1880s by L. L. Zamenhof, a Polish-Jewish ophthalmologist from Bialystok, then part of the Russian Empire, but now part of Poland. According to Zamenhof, he created the language to reduce the \"time and labour we spend in learning foreign tongues\" and to foster harmony between people from different countries.  \"Were there but an international language, all translations would be made into it alone\u00a0... and all nations would be united in a common brotherhood.\"  He opposed Zionism and occupation of Palestine and wanted Jews and Muslims to live in peace and harmony. He lived in a time of oppression of Jews and he started something called \"Homaranismo\".  Zamenhof wanted people to free their minds from the narrow fact that things such as a Jew, a Russian or a German even exist. He called for us to understand ourselves not as a part of a religion, language or a race but simply as human beings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are the first four dogmas of Homaranismo, the most principal and general:\n\n1. I am a human and I exist solely for purely human ideals; I view all sorts of ideals and targeted nationalisms as nothing but group egotism and hate towards people, which sooner or later must disappear and their disappearance I must be a catalyst to, to the best of my ability.\n2. I believe, that all populations are equal and I evaluate all people only by their personal value and deeds but not according to descent. For this I regard all persecutions carried out against others based on the fact that they were born to a different race, with a different language or religion as barbarism.\n3. I believe that every country does not belong to one or another race, but more justly to all its inhabitants, regardless of language or religion; I view the shuffling of interests of the land and the interests of one or the other race, language or religion as leftovers from barbaric times, when the fist and sword right was solely accepted.\n4. I believe that in one's own family one has indisputable, complete and natural right speak whichever language and dialect they may desire, and adhere to whichever religion they themselves choose, but in communications with people of different descent one should, when possible, use a neutral language and live according to also religion neutral principles. All striving of one person to impose one's language or religion onto others I view as a barbaric act.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome final thoughts....\n\nI have thought deeply about this over the years and I think the word \"Monero\" fits great for a currency...I am from India and although Esperanto does not closely relate to any language there, I find it very easy to learn and speak.  Esperanto could very well be a key language to know in the future. Like crypto, Esperanto is not only a \"structured thing\" created by us, it also creates a level playing field for everyone. Imagine going to a different country and not having to worry about learning a new language. Esperanto could be the default language of the universe. I am not saying forget your culture and your language, I am simply saying Esperanto could be a great extra language to help create better relationships and business ties across the globe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese are some of the reasons I love the Monero project.

Ripple has flooded the market this quarter.\n\nNot only did Ripple increase their sales/release of XRP this quarter (Q1) with 40-50% from last quarter (Q4), but there are strong indications that as of mid April, Ripple started selling at an even higher rate than the Q1 level.

In 2018 everyone was talking about bitcoin, but with the price so high I didn't trust it yet. Felt it was booming because of people jumping in and that it would soon crash, which it did. About a month ago I started looking at bitcoin as an investment again, and everything seemed solid. I looked into wallets, how to purchase bitcoin, articles, everything, and I liked what I saw. For whatever reason that escapes me I forgot about it/neglected to follow up. This morning I randomly decided to check the price and it broke the threshold all of the articles I had seen were talking about.

But this seems like a good place to talk about some of the macroeconomic effects of inflation vs. deflation.\n\nWe have never run a modern economy on a deflationary asset such as Bitcoin, literally nobody knows for sure if it can even work. \n\nSome things to consider - while it coincides with the industrial revolution and drawing a straight line from cause to effect can be hard in macroeconomics, we have seen unprecedented growth in the global economy since leaving behind the gold standard, and then the silver standard. There are a lot of people who argue that this is at least in part because in an inflationary economy access to credit becomes a lot cheaper, and as liquidity goes up it becomes easier to access too. \n\nGenerally speaking being able to borrow money is a good thing for an economy, provided there's reasonable risk management in place. Yes, I know, we had a major recession predicated on debt, but reckless speculation and a lack of oversight are the bigger culprits. Access to credit doesn't mean access to credit for everyone, all the time for any reason.\n\nThere's good reason to think that in a deflationary economy there will be less incentive for people to loan money, leading to lower liquidity, and higher relative interest rates, i.e. the price of borrowing will go up. The reason is simple - you're more motivated to invest if your money is losing value stuffed in your mattress. If it's gaining value sitting there doing nothing why take the risk of giving it to someone else who might not pay you back? They'd better make it worth your while, that's for sure.\n\nIs this a good thing for a global economy? Will it lead to slower economic growth? Will economies be more or less stable? Literally nobody knows. And while a lot of people argue that the current system is unjust and serves only to make the rich richer, it's not guaranteed that we'll see something better from crypto. Letting people be their own banks is a good start, there are definitely some inherent properties of bitcoin baked in that make it a powerful tool economic freedom, but it also records every transaction in a public log, which is great for security, but bad for privacy.\n\nAll of these problems have solutions, but even Satoshi was only luke warm on the 21 million limit. Would baked in 1% inflation be a bad thing? Coins are lost every day, private keys holding crypto are lost and destroyed every day. A small amount of inflation would, ideally, make Bitcoin neither inflationary or deflationary, but might actually keep the global supply of coins fairly stable. I'm not necessarily advocating for it, but these are not crazy questions to be asking. I know that nobody wants to see the value of their coins go down, and there's a lot of libertarian resistance to the idea of anything that even faintly resembles a central bank printing money, but it deserves more thought than a simple knee-jerk reaction that being pro-inflation means you're anti-crypto.", "yall cancelling people for the lightest shit but then say jimmy page, a man who wore parts of nazi uniforms, wrote https://t.co/bG6qnw00bu", "Because security comes at a cost.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin is inflating, meaning your savings in BTC are actually losing value slightly (this is a loss \"on top\" of any gains BTC will have as it increases adoption and utility --- if not for the subsidy, the BTC value would be even higher today).  That value loss is going to the miners, in the form of new coins (i.e. the inflation).  In short, at least for now, people who are saving money are paying part of their savings to secure the network.\n\nHowever, once those savings have been secured by being deeply buried in the blockchain, the loss in savings should stop (or at least slow down greatly; that's the halvening every 4 years or thereabouts).\n\nBut miners still have to be paid.  So the rule is that every change in the state of the existing savings --- i.e. every transfer from some existing savings to control of another entity, i.e. a transaction --- must pay in order to ensure security of that transfer.  That's the transaction fees.  As the subsidy reduces, the cost to secure the chain must still be paid, this time by those who want to change the ownership of coins.  Thus the fees cannot be made 0.\n\n----\n\nThe other side is that Adjustable Blocksize Cap thing.  There are a bunch of intersecting problems here.\n\nEach block has a price to generate that block.  The total energy spent to create the block is the price of that block.  The value has to come from somewhere --- currently, that's the subsidy plus what little fees there are.\n\nNow one way to increase fees is to increase the block size.  Hence the many many many moves to do so.\n\nThe problem is that at the lower layers (i.e. Internet layer) the effect of block size is massive.  For one, fullnodes tend not to be created when block sizes are large --- consider Ethereum, where nobody can start a new fullnode anymore, because of the block size problem they created for themselves.  More fullnodes mean generally greater security and privacy, since the ability to lie about the blockchain becomes harder the more fullnodes there are.\n\nAnother issue is that every millisecond counts for miners.  When a new block arrives, a miner can't be sure they can safely build on top of that block until they verify that block; they either stop mining momentarily, or mine on top of the incoming block before they can confirm it's valid.  The former is wasted time for them (and mining hardware is going to be suffer more damage if they keep switching it on and off at high speed; in practice they just waste the energy here rather than reduce the lifetime of their equipment); the latter is risky in case of a targeted attack by another miner with more hashpower than them.\n\nNow, there are two costs in block verification: transmitting the transactions in the block, and actually verifying the transactions in each block.  Bitcoin has a FIBRE network that improves the speed of transmitting the transactions in a block; Bitcoin also has ubermensch [Pieter Wuille][/u/pwuille] that improves the Bitcoin Core source code to speed up verifying transactions.\n\nIf the block verification time increases, then it becomes possible to perform certain attacks to effectively increase your hashpower without, you know, actually increasing your hashpower.  When a miner wins a block, that miner knows immediately that the block it just made is valid, but other miners still have to double-check that block.  Thus the milliseconds needed by other miners to receive and verify that block is a vital advantage the winning miner has.  If the miner has high hashpower, it could win the next block again, which increases its time advantage over the other miners again.  This means the miner effectively has higher hashpower than it actually has, unless the block verification time is negligible.\n\nNow, ***obviously*** increasing the block size is going to increase the block verification time, duh, how could it not?  If it increases the block verification time to more than a dozen milliseconds, it becomes possible for miners with a large share of the hashpower to increase their effective hashpower rate by stealing it from smaller miners.  This means that miners with large hashpower might look like they have < 51% on paper, but actually have effectively more than that by kicking off smaller miners (via block verification time).  And once Bitcoin has been 51% attacked, it is possible to censor transactions, and with the existence of timelocks, possibly even prevent protocols built on top of Bitcoin from operating correctly (cross-chain swaps, CoinSwap, Lightning...).\n\nRecently (mid 2017) Bitcoin already increased blocksize by around 2x via SegWit.  Note that Bitcoin FIBRE had to be upgraded before then to support the increased capacity.  Further capacity increases require even more optimization of Bitcoin FIBRE and Bitcoin Core before they are even considered.", "#BTC #MCR #ETH Bitcoins bulls were back on the offensive Thursday, driving the price back above $12,000 for the fi https://t.co/Osef09geS4", "RT @ItsTamone: Ive always wondered what Whitney Houston would have sounded like on a song produced by Jimmy Jam &amp; Terry Lewis.

Ruben Somsen claims, in the [linked Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/SomsenRuben/status/1115920065101045760), that:\n\n> Block space is given to the highest bidder - if nobody bids, it's practically free. If you think mass replicated immutable blockchain data is at least worth something, then it logically follows that blocks WILL be full.\n\nUnfortunately, he misses a key point.  __Miners set the minimum acceptable fees__, always. To extend Ruben's auction analogy, miners are quite free to set a \"[reserve price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reserve-price.asp)\" on bids for block space. They can do this without full blocks. If nobody meets a miner's reserve price for block space, guess what happens? The miner mines an empty block. This is absolutely essential to understand when thinking about the supply and demand dynamics for transaction processing and block size.\n\nUnfortunately, Ruben does not understand this. Therefore, he thinks that the only way to make people pay for their Bitcoin transactions is to limit the block size with a cap. I have tried to educate him and others in the small block camp, but they refuse to consider that they might be wrong and have an open mind. They prefer to stick to places where they can benefit from censorship of ideas they find distasteful. It's their loss.\n\n__We do not need full blocks__ for Bitcoin to sustain itself, even after the block reward drops to 0 after we're all dead.  We simply need miners who are able to set minimum transaction fees.  And, guess what, we already have that!  Miners, who determine Nakamoto Consensus, can and should be able to dynamically adjust the size of their blocks in order for supply to meet demand naturally and unconstrained by supply caps.  I can get behind block size caps that are based in technological limitations, but that is *not* what the 1MB size/4MB weight cap in Bitcoin is about.

One of the most interesting things emerging from this particular bear market has been a concept known as \u201cdecentralized finance,\u201d manifested primarily by services that allow you to earn interest or borrow against your cryptocurrency holdings.What Is DeFi?Decentralized finance, or \u201cDeFi\u201d for short, is an umbrella concept describing any financial services that are built on top of public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It also encompasses all ICO activity, which, at present, mostly takes place on Ethereum.Stablecoins like Tether and Gemini dollar, which are essentially just IOUs for fiat sitting in reserves, do not qualify as DeFi projects by their inherent nature. Maker, on the other hand, includes both a collateralized lending system and stablecoin (DAI) that are both decentralized \u2014 making it more of a fit under the DeFi umbrella.Several systems have emerged that also offer DeFi lending services like Dharma Lever (https://www.dharmalever.com/), Compound (https://compound.finance/) and Celsius Network (https://celsius.network/). Other services, like dYdX (https://dydx.exchange/) and Nuo (https://app.nuo.network/), allow you to short, hedge or margin trade. Prediction markets are also an emerging decentralized financial service, with Augur (https://www.augur.net/) being the most relevant example. Consistent among all of these services, and all that decentralized finance has to offer, is that it requires no third party, bank or clearing house, and often is entirely permissionless.DeFi and BitcoinBitcoin itself, at the most basic level, may be considered the original decentralized finance project. People who use Bitcoin are already acting as their own banks (as long as they control their own private keys) and can permissionlessly exchange value with whomever they want, anywhere. While this the simplest form of decentralized finance, it may also be the most powerful. Bitcoin users are able to open up \u201cbank accounts,\u201d or new wallets, in seconds. They can securely store their wealth in a value that is protected by mathematics from random inflation and can spend this value however they want.The question of whether or not more sophisticated, decentralized financial services will migrate to Bitcoin is not a matter of if, but when. Over time, Bitcoin sidechains may be able to provide services similar to what we are seeing on Ethereum. Today, however, Ethereum is much better designed to handle DeFi services due to its complex smart contract capabilities.Nonetheless, new projects are already being envisioned on Bitcoin, like Bitcoin Hivemind (http://bitcoinhivemind.com/). According to the website, Hivemind is a \u201cPeer-to-Peer Oracle Protocol which absorbs accurate data into a blockchain so that Bitcoin users can speculate in Prediction Markets.\u201dWhy Is DeFi Growing?Decentralized finance is becoming popular for several key reasons, which are all parallel to the ethos of Bitcoin itself. There are no banks on which people need to rely, no trust is needed to interact with the other party, access is available 24/7 and settlements are relatively fast.And the numbers speak for themselves. As of March 2019, the amount of value locked in DeFi projects stands at $338 million, according to Delphi Digital\u2019s thematic overview of DeFi. (https://www.delphidigital.io/defi) The research firm\u2019s overview showcases the popular DeFi services, which they categorize by \u201cDEXs,\u201d \u201cLending and Borrowing\u201d protocols and \u201cDerivatives, Margin Trading, & Prediction Markets.\u201dDelphi also cited potential benefits of DeFi as being permissionless, censorship resistant, immutable, programmable and offering minimal counterparty risk. An important note, however, is that the report did not address the potential systematic risks of decentralized finance. Rather, it cited only", "Had a bag of it when it was 8-10 $ before DAO hack which made me sell everything. But after seeing projects like DAI, Nuo, bZx, Kyber I've decided to buy back into ETH. Margin trading on Nuo and bZx in decentralized fashion without being worried about security, KYC and other centralized exchanges problems is AMAZING.\n\nWith that being said I have some questions if you don't mind since I'm out of the sync with Ethereum:\n\n1. How far are we (estimate) from PoS on the mainnet?\n2. What will happen with token inflation when we switch on PoS? \n3.

Debt is ridiculously high and we are starting to see the problems this issue bring, in the form of pissed working class who vote to whoever says what they want to hear (Brexit, Trump, Bolsonaro, etc.). But the problem is far from being solved, and I think the shit is about to hit the fan sometime beginning of next year. Who knows what will happen then.\n\nHowever, there are many countries (central and south America for example) that have been in trouble for the past decades and nothing has really worked them. And there libertarianism is starting to get more and more followers. They know first hand what happens when you have a left wing progressive party or even a communist government and central banks printing money. Right wing conservative parties are no much better. They had enough and they are starting to realize libertarianism could be the way, and most haven't heard about bitcoin yet.\n\nI am realizing that if libertarian parties don't start gaining traction soon in the most developed countries, bitcoin and the cryptocurrency space in general could face many difficulties.\n\nOne thing is for sure: you either believe in bitcoin as the way to have a deflationary economic system, and the only way to get there is with libertarian governments, or you are here to increase your bag of fiat.

Unfortunately, it is held back by its primal roots in evolution, which it hasn't yet been able to shed. If you've been wondering why alien life forms have not tried to make contact yet, this is the reason. Higher life forms would never consider contacting a semi-intelligent species, until they prove capable of the higher intelligence which ensures that they will be sticking around more than a few hundred or thousand years. The majority of what we today call homo sapiens has probably not evolved into homo superior yet and (unfortunately) will not spontaneously evolve superpowers (besides higher intelligence capacity). The only way that homo superior can possibly take the reigns is through a cataclysmic event that wipes out most of the human population. (Un)fortunately, the probability that this will happen constantly increases, especially given the prevalence of barbaric Sap drama. Even more worrisome is the possibility of stepping back evolutionarily when it does happen.\n\nThe title of this article is slightly misleading, because if you've read this far, you're probably not a Sap, but I don't believe that we currently have any known adequate test to differentiate between the two species since the difference is so subtle and dependent on environmental factors. The general trend for humanity is also to corral all humans into general education programs that are getting dumber by the day, and in general to halt any evolutionary progress on the general population. Is this offensive to \"inferior gene\" people? No, I'm simply stating the fact that certain genes are superior in certain environments. No other terrestrial genes besides ones that promote higher intelligence will propel any lifeform to become interplanetary and be able to survive a mass extinction event. In an environment where you are destined to succumb to any number of planetary mass-extinction events, it is a guarantee that you or your genes and offspring will mostly end at some point, unless you figure out how to planet-hop. Which means that the alien life forms that are observing our planet (if they are) don't care that we have quantum computers because we can lose that knowledge in a flash. What they are waiting for, is to see a self-sustaining interplanetary species, or a gravitational wave consistent with a successful test of an Alcubierre drive (a \"Zephram Cochrane\" moment, if you will) which guarantees that life originating from this planet will be around far longer than a cosmic \"blink of an eye\" and is a force to be reckoned with (hopefully with a friendly welcome).\n\nSo, unfortunately, it doesn't matter whether you're a Sap, or a Sup. Until Elon can accomplish his goals, the rest of us will probably die enslaved to the fiat ponzi schemes of our tax dollars, paying for barbaric wars and other wastefulness that only makes the rich Saps richer, oblivious to any proof of alien life forms that are avoiding us like the plague. The story has not changed in millenia. Maybe it would change before the next such extinction event, especially if more billionaire \"Elons\" would step up to the plate, but unfortunately, most of them seem intently focused on living the life of luxury while increasing their wealth.  \nNow get back to work so you can pay your bills and taxes because they're about to print more money to devalue your meager paycheck, slave...\n\nDon't like it?\n\nLong BTC, short the banksters, and prove that you're not a Sap by continuing to learn and contribute until the day you die.", "ICYMI: Thomas More all-conference offensive lineman Brandon Lee '08 was a big part to the success of the https://t.co/1So49qsJ0V", "$LEO testing that USD all time high, whilst the BTC pair looks like shit.

But one I want to share with you guys. Maybe it can help someone with the same problems, maybe we can improve something. So let me start my story.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI checked a few delivery services in my area and found one that offers Bitcoins as a payment method. Since I never really used Bitcoin for payments I thought, let's try this and maybe I can even convince my wife that Bitcoin is pretty useable now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I chose my Pizza and some food for the wife and went on to pay for it. I had some Bitcoin (about 20 USD) on my phone wallet (Eclair) and thought that should be an easy deal. Yeah, how wrong I was...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI got to the payment process and they forwarded me to Bitpay. First thing I see is \"choose your currency\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\no) Bitcoin (network cost 0.50 USD)\n\no) Bitcoin Cash (network cost 0.00 USD)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt kinda felt like they wanted to push me towards BCH (maybe that's just me). But it's still nice to have some options to pay. Especially because the food delivery service only offered Bitcoin payments on his homepage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the same time, a countdown started to finish my payment before the order gets rejected (about 15 min).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I chose Bitcoin and got a QR code I can scan to pay it. I scanned the code with my wallet and got the error \"This is not a valid Bitcoin address\". Well, shit. My countdown was already down to 12 minutes so I had to hurry and figure out what's wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext step I tried to copy the address and paste it into my wallet, but still not working. I was just getting some strange looking link (bitcoin:?r=[https://bitpay.com/i/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx](https://bitpay.com/i/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)). Countdown was down to 10 minutes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter that, I looked it up on google and saw that Bitpay seemingly tries to force feed their own wallet on you to make payments. Since I didn't want to download their wallet or even send my money there (especially because I only had a few minutes left), I looked further and found some help on Bitcointalk. Some users there found a way around this with using a decoder that changes the Bitpay link into an actual Bitcoin address. ([https://decoder.bip70.org/](https://decoder.bip70.org/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe site itself didn't look that trustworthy but since I only got about 3 minutes left I went on to gave it a try. I sent my Bitcoin to the decoded address. And look there, it worked. Bitpay told me they see my payment but we need to wait for confirmation. But wait, there is more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince I didn't look into the payment details I did send a little bit too much money (included too much transaction fees). So I ended up paying something like 3x the from Bitpay recommended fee. But I didn't mind that so much. What troubled me was the message Bitpay showed me, it was something like that:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"This payment was made with a low bitcoin miner fee, which may prevent it from being accepted by the bitcoin network. This is an issue with the configuration of your bitcoin wallet. If the transaction doesn't confirm, the funds will be again in your wallet in about 48-72 hours.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I was like, what? How could the fee be to low if I used three times more than recommended? Should I now wait 72 hours before ordering a new Pizza? Becoming more and more hungry I still decided to wait out and see if my transactions will get confirmed. And my patience got rewarded, about half an hour later they confirmed my payment and the order got routed to the Pizza Restaurant. An hour later I finally got my Pizza and it was delicious. Well, maybe because I was already dying because I was so hungry but still. At least I had a happy end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNeedlessness to say, I couldn't convince my wife to use Bitcoin for further Pizza deliveries. Moreover, I can't even recommend it to anyone new to Bitcoin because that was quite a shitty experience. Mostly because of Bitpay I would argue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't get me wrong, I really love Bitcoin and the opportunities it provides.  But it seems, we still have a long way to go for mass adoption (or even an easy way to order Pizza).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince I would love to improve that process I thought about sending that delivery service some feedback. To even give them an opportunity to improve, I think they would have to move away from Bitpay to another payment service.

These days, money transfer and online payments have become a part of life.\n\nThe increasing popularity of e-commerce has played a significant role in the growing demand for online payments. CITL believes that though the current payment system is meeting the demand, there are a lot of gaps that can be filled by more effective methods of money transfer. Blockchain technology and Cryptocurrencies are a way to make money transfer more efficient, easy, and accessible from anywhere anytime.\n\nCITL believes in continuous upgradation of technology and is among the very first companies in Tanzania to offer fintech products in the country. The company has plans to transform the global payment system and money transfer through cryptocurrencies and blockchain Technology. CITL is planning to utilize the market volatility of both cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies in the global financial market to create a decentralized cryptocurrency \u201cConnect Coin (XCON)\u201d. CITL believes there are certain issues with the use of fiat currencies such as:-\n\n**Cross-Border Payments:** When fiat currency depreciates it causes inflation which is a huge problem for the businesses which have global reach. People do not find it safe and convenient to exchange the fiat currency into regional currencies while travelling worldwide.\n\n**Bank Access:** In the developing world, only 41% of people have access to bank accounts. So, the remaining 59% population cannot easily make transactions or trade inside or outside the country.\n\n**Double Spending:** The use of credit or debit card for online purchases expose the user to online fraud because the same data can be used by other parties without the authorization of the owner.\n\n**Identity Theft:** Fiat currency transactions do not allow users to transact online without the declaration of their identity. The Identity information of the user is sent with the transaction along with other data. This information can become vulnerable online.\n\n**Data Tampering:** Fiat currency data can be counterfeited.\n\n**Fees:** Because of the centralization of fiat currencies, the associated fee usually remains very high.\n\n# Connect Coin (XCON) \u2013 The Imperative Blockchain Solution\n\nConnect Coin is one of the vital product offerings of CITL that is developed with an objective to \u2018connect the world.\u2019 It is a standard ERC-20 Ethereum-based coin that intends to connect buyers and sellers from around the world by enabling them to be a part of Connect Global Marketplace.\n\nConsumers can purchase from sellers and merchants across the globe and pay efficiently through Connect Coin, thereby reducing the hassle of converting money to local currencies. The platform also enables consumers to pay for good and services using the Connect App as well as Connect Cards.\n\n# Connect Card \u2013 Improving Global Payment System\n\nBuilt on blockchain technology connect card envisions to improve the digital payment system. It simplifies cryptocurrency transactions and makes their use practical in real-life. Through Connect Card users can easily withdraw funds (XCON) in fiat money", "Again this BULLSHIT political propaganda here?!  \nStop posting this bullshit, please!

Even John McAfe https://t.co/QxpbxG0uDY", "### Submitted by [saltyskip](https://github.com/saltyskip)\n\nThis NEP will propose an economic model adjustment to the distribution of GAS created through mining, system fees, and network fees. Additionally it will propose a permanent inflation to GAS mining in the NEO ecosystem. With these changes it will provide a clearer seperation of concerns between NEO (the governing token) and GAS (the utility token), as well as better align the incentives between the NEO holders and consensus nodes.\n\n## Motivation\n\nLet us first consider three goals of the NEO network protocol\n\n**Goal 1:** Have network fees be low while being resistant to spam attack  \n**Goal 2:** Effectively reward consensus nodes while still aligning their interests with NEO holders/users  \n**Goal 3:** Encourage circulation and spending of GAS within the NEO ecosystem\n\n*From this point on, I will use NEO holders and NEO network users interchangeably, as functionally they are the same group of people*\n\nI have distilled these goals based on discussion located [here](https://github.com/neo-project/neo/issues/285) along with other discussions amongst the community.\n\nIn the current iteration of NEO, none of these goals are being properly met, but we can work towards achieving them in NEO 3.0.\n\nIn order to achieve these goals. I propose three necessary changes to the protocol.\n\n**Action 1:** Network fees are no longer distributed to consensus nodes, but instead NEO holders.  \n**Action 2:** GAS generation does not go to zero in twenty two years but instead asymptotically levels off to a fixed inflation rate  \n**Action 3:** Consensus nodes collect a percentage of mined gas indefinitely, instead of network fees\n\nI believe with these three implementation changes we will be able to effectively achieve the three goals that I have mentioned above.\n\n## Rationale\n\n### Low Network Fees and Spam\n\nCurrently the NEO network has 0 fees which makes it susceptible to apam. We have already seen spam attacks carried on the test network, and most recently on the main network as well. The natural solution to spam attacks is to \n\n* 1. Limit the number of free transactions per block\n* 2. Make users attach fees to their transactions attach fees to transactions\n\nThis will generally render spam useless or require the spammer to pay more and more money in order to continue his attack. The problem with this solution is that it HARMS NEO holders and HELPS consensus nodes.\n\nLet\u2019s consider an escalation in a fee war between a spammer and the users of the NEO network. As the fees gradually rise, the consensus nodes will continue to get more and more profits while the users of the network suffer. This creates a perverse incentive where the consensus nodes actually have an incentive to spam the network because they will collect all the fees associated with the spam.\n\nSo in the current iteration of Network fee implementation, consensus nodes and spammers prosper from high fees while users suffer.\n\nIf we adjust so that network fees are instead paid out to the NEO holders, then the spammer will be paying the network users to continue his spam attack. If the attacker\u2019s goal is to harm the NEO network paying large sums of money to the NEO holders is completely counter productive.\n\nUsers will effectively be subsidized in a fee war by the spammer, and although it maybe annoying is signficantly less harmful than the previous solution.\n\nThere is one big problem, in this scenario we have completely removed the incentives for consensus nodes entirely. We will disccuss how to adjust the model so that consensus nodes can still be rewarded in this system later.\n\nHowever, with this adjustment I believe we have achieved Goal 1, which is keeping network fees as low as possible while still being resistant to spam attacks.\n\n### Asymptotic Gas Inflation\n\nCurrently as stated in the whitepaper, gas generation is meant to bootstrap the network and distribute it amongst NEO holders, and while this is a good goal, it leads to many problems.\n\nIn this system GAS becomes a deflationary currency over time. This means it encourages the hoarding of GAS rather than the spending of GAS. We see this time and time again with crypto assets that try to be a \u201cmeans of transfer.\u201d\n\n**If something is meant to be used as good means of transfer (utility coin) as opposed to a store of value it SHOULD be inflationary.**\n\nGAS will not be able to fulfill its main purpose of utility if it is a deflationary currency.\n\nTo make matters worse, the deflationary nature of GAS is accelerated by not only lost GAS, but also by NEO black holes which continually accumulate GAS, and remove it from the system entirely. We can combat black holes by making sure that the amount of GAS lost to it always remains below the inflation rate. This makes the GAS supply more stable, and disincentivizes users from hoarding GAS. Encouraging users to spend GAS on network fees and system fees (as well as for purchases outside of the network) will, in the long run, be much more positive for the NEO ecosystem.\n\nWe are extremely lucky to be able to leverage the dual token model to have one asset be used as a store of value, and one asset to be used as a means of exchange. Deflation is good for a store of value, and inflation is good for a means of exchange.\n\nMaking GAS inflationary solidifies the use case and seperation for NEO and GAS instead of blurring the lines.\n\nSo by making GAS inflationary we have achieved Goal 3 which is encouraging use and spending of GAS in the NEO ecosystem.\n\n### Consensus Node Rewards\n\nWith inflationary gas we can now effectively reward consensus nodes without ever putting them in conflict with the users. Consensus nodes can now be rewarded with a fixed or percentage amount from the mined GAS, so that they are always incentivized to keep producing blacks, and the network stable because that is their only source of income.\n\nThey do not have to worry about any sorts of fees, and are encourage to maintain a passive role in the ecosystem. They will be encouraged to find the best ways to keep block times low, and network uptime very high which also benefits users. Thus we have achieved goal [\\#2](https://github.com/neo-project/neo/pull/2) of effectively incentivizing consensus nodes without having any conflict between them and the users.\n\nFinally running consensus nodes has as fixed cost associated with it. It should have a fixed reward as well\n\n## Specification\n\nThe main parameters we need to consider are the inflation rate, and the ratio of mined gas that is split between the consensus nodes and NEO holders. However more discussion is needed about the proposal at hand before these parameters can be considered", "The Ethereum community wants Progpow for months.

They loan it out to other people, invest it, and do other shit with it that enables them to grow their bottom line. Same idea goes with Bitcoin. When we leave our coins on exchanges, we are in essence, handing them all the power. Some of the biggest bitcoin wallets today belong to no other than the exchanges...\n\nHowever, unlike the big banks, crypto exchanges do not have any regulatory authority who will call them out or fine them for taking advantage of people who don't know any better. These exchanges can then inflate volume, inflate prices, or do whatever the fk they want with our coins and nobody has the ability to even monitor them much less tell them to stop.\n\nLook, if you're an active trader or something, I get it. It's easiest to just leave your coins on an exchange and trade it when there is sudden action. In pretty much any other case, consider that this behavior contributes to the single most debilitating factor of crypto, centralization.\n\nTL/DR - The beauty (one beauty at least) of Bitcoin is that we control our own money. Don't leave coins on exchanges and give them all the power. Transfer them to a wallet where you and only YOU control the keys. This one factor alone will contribute to the progress of Bitcoin greater than anything else.\n\nGood luck out there ladies and gents.

That would be [VISA-level scale](https://usa.visa.com/run-your-business/small-business-tools/retail.html) (which handles, on average, 1736tx/s). We often hear that we shouldn't raise the blocksize because then nodes would become too expensive to run. But how expensive exactly?\n\nWe have the following costs to take into account:\n\n* Storage\n* Bandwidth\n* CPU/Memory\n* Electricity\n\nFor now, I'm going to assume a *non-pruned* full node (i.e. a node that *stores all transactions* of the blockchain) for personal use, i.e. for a computer built at home. I'll add in the calculations for a pruned node at the end, which would likely be the prefered option for people who merely want to verify the blockchain for themselves. If you don't care about the assumptions and calculations, you can just jump right to the end of this post. If you spotted any error, please inform me and I'll update my calculation.\n\n# Storage\n\nThere's, on average, one block every 10 minutes, that is 144 every day and 4320 blocks every thirty days. [I was able to find a 3TB HDD for $47,50 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/7200RPM-Cache-Internal-Desktop-Warranty/dp/B00X37FQBU/ref=sr_1_10?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=Y62Z63H30X82&keywords=3tb+hard+drive&qid=1554538883&s=gateway&sprefix=3tb+h%2Caps%2C219&sr=8-10), that is $0.018/GB. Storing all blocks with all transactions of a month (4320GB) would be **$78.96/mo**. Prices for [storage *halved* from 2014 to 2017](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/hard-drive-cost-per-gigabyte/), so we can assume that to half in 2022, thus we can reasonably assume it'd cost around **$40/mo.** in 2022.\n\nBut would such an inexpensive hard disk be able to keep up with writing all the data? I found a comparable cheap HDD which can [write 127MB/s sequentially](https://hdd.userbenchmark.com/SpeedTest/14588/Hitachi-HUS724030ALE640) (which would be the writing mode of Bitcoin). That would be enough even for 76GB blocks!\n\n# Bandwidth\n\nBandwidth is more complicated, because that can't just be shipped around like HDDs. I'll just take prices for my country, Germany, using the provider T-online, because I don't know how it works in the US. You can plug in your own numbers based on the calculations below.\n\n1GB blocks/10 minute mean **1.7MB/s**. However, this is an average, and we need some wiggle room for transaction spikes, for example at Christmas or Black Friday. VISA handles 150 million transactions per day, that is 1736tx/s, but can handle up to 24,000tx/s ([source](https://usa.visa.com/run-your-business/small-business-tools/retail.html)). So we should be able to handle **13.8x** the average throughput, which would be 1.7MB/s x 13.8 = **23.46M/s**, or 187.68Mbit/s. The [plan on T-online for 250Mbit/s](https://tarifbestellen.t-online.de/telekom-festnetz-tarife-magenta-zuhause-5768?) ([translated](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Ftarifbestellen.t-online.de%2Ftelekom-festnetz-tarife-magenta-zuhause-5768%3F)) would be 54.95\u20ac/mo (plus setup minus a discount for the first 6 months which seems to cancel out so we'll ignore it), which would be **$61.78/mo**. This plan is an actual *flatrate*, so we don't have to worry about hitting any download limit.\n\nNote, however, that we don't order bandwidth for only our Bitcoin node, but also for personal use. If we only needed 2MB/s for personal use, the plan would be 34.95\u20ac, thus our node would actually only cost the difference of 20\u20ac per month, or **$22.50/mo**. [Nielsen's Law of Internet Bandwidth](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/law-of-bandwidth/) claims that a high-end user's connection speed **grows by 50% per year**. If we assume this is true for pricing too, the bandwidth cost for \\~200Mbit/s/mo. would go down to 12.5% of its today's cost by 2022, which decreases our number to **$2.81/mo**.\n\n# CPU/Memory\n\nCPU/Memory will be bought once and can then run for [tens of years](https://superuser.com/a/1272750), so we'll count these as setup costs. The specs needed, of course, depend on the optimization of the node software, but we'll assume the current bottlenecks will have been removed once running a node actually becomes demanding hardware-wise.\n\n[This paper](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/ed25519-20110926.pdf) establishes that a 2.4GHz Intel Westmere (Xeon E5620) CPU can verify 71000 signatures per second... which can be [bought for **$32.88** a pair](https://www.ebay.com/itm/2-LOT-SLBV4-Intel-Xeon-E5620-2-4GHz-12MB-5-86GT-S-LGA1366-CPU-Quad-Core-Westmere/142677210853?hash=item21383976e5:g:7fwAAOSwISRadJy0) on Ebay (note: this CPU is from [Q1'10](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/47925/intel-xeon-processor-e5620-12m-cache-2-40-ghz-5-86-gt-s-intel-qpi.html)). We'd need to verify 76659tx/s at spikes (taking the 13.8x number), so that pair of CPUs (handle 142,000tx/s) seem to just fit right in (given one signature per tx). We'd also have to account for multiple signatures per transaction and all the other parts of verification of transactions, but it seems like the CPU costs are neglegible anyway if we don't buy the freshest hardware available. **\\~$100** at current prices seem reasonable. Given Moore's Law, we can assume that prices for CPUs half every two years (transistor count x1.416^(2)), so in three years, the CPU(s) should cost around **$35.22** ($100/1.416^(3)).\n\nFor memory, we again have to take into account the transaction spikes. If we're very unlucky, and transactions spike **and** there won't be a block for \\~1h, the mempool can become very large. If we take the factor of 13.8x from above, and 1h of unconfirmed transactions (20,000,000tx usually, 276,000,000tx on spikes), we'd need 82.8GB (for 300B per transaction).\n\nI found [32GB of RAM (with ECC) for $106](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Samsung-4GB-8GB-16GB-32GB-LR-DDR3-1333-1600MHZ-ECC-REG-Registered-Server-ram-LOT/362204359811?hash=item54550fec83%3Am%3AmWZjoc7-inPurU9Z-fp_cGA&LH_BIN=1), so three of those give us 96GB of RAM for **$318** and plenty remaining space for building hash trees, connection management and the operating system. Buying used hardware doesn't seem to decrease the cost significantly (we actually do need a lot of RAM, compared to CPU power).\n\nPrice of RAM seems to decrease by a factor of [x100 every 10 years](https://www.quora.com/Is-the-Moores-law-for-RAM-dead/answer/Sean-Thompson) (x1.585^(10)), so we can expect 96GB to cost around **$79.89** ($318/1.585^(3)) in 2022.\n\nOf course, CPU and memory need to be compatible, which I haven't taken into account. Chug a mainboard (\\~$150) and a power supply (\\~$50) into the mix, and the total would be just over **$600** for today's prices. Even if mainboard and power supply prices remain the same, we'd still only have to pay around **$315** for the whole setup in 2022.\n\n# Electricity\n\nI found the following power consumptions:\n\n* [The CPU requires](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/47925/intel-xeon-processor-e5620-12m-cache-2-40-ghz-5-86-gt-s-intel-qpi.html) **80W**\n* [Mainboard needs](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-radeon-power,2122-7.html) **40W**\n* 3 [memory modules](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-radeon-power,2122-7.html) with **9W**\n* I found a [comparable harddrive](https://www.amazon.de/Toshiba-DT01ACA300-interne-Festplatte-7200rpm/dp/B009AYWYOC) with **6W**. We need N\\*6W, where N is the number of hardrives (17.28 per year).\n\nSo we'd have **129W + N\\*6W**. Electricity cost [average at 12ct/kWh](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2011/10/27/141766341/the-price-of-electricity-in-your-state?t=1554547490967) in the US, in Germany this is higher [at 30.22ct/kWh](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/what-german-households-pay-power). In the US, it would cost **$11.14 + N\\*$0.52** (P\\*12ct/kWh / 1000 \\* 24h/day \\*30days / 100ct/$), in Germany **28.06\u20ac + N\\*1.30\u20ac**.\n\nAt the end of the first year, it would cost **$20.12/mo.** in the US and between **50.52\u20ac/mo.** in Germany.\n\nAt the end of the second year, it would cost **$29.11/mo**. for the US and **72.98\u20ac/mo** for Germany. It increases by $8.98/mo. per year in the US and by 22.46\u20ac/mo. per year in Germany.\n\nElectricity prices in Germany have increased over time due to increased taxation; in the US the price increase has been [below inflation rate](http://www.in2013dollars.com/Electricity/price-inflation) the last two decades. As it's difficult to predict price changes here, I'm going to assume prices will remain the same.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn summary, we get:\n\n* Storage: $78.96/mo., $40/mo in 2022\n* Bandwidth: $22.50/mo., $2.81/mo. in 2022\n* Electricity: $20.12/mo. (1st year, US), $29.11/mo (2nd year, US); 50.52\u20ac/mo. (1st year, DE), 72.98\u20ac/mo (2nd year; DE)\n* CPU: Initially $600, $315 in 2022\n\nIf we add everything up, for today's prices, we get **$130/mo. (US)**, **$183/mo. (DE)** for the second year and **$71.92/mo. (US)**, **$115.79/mo. (DE)** in 2022.\n\nIt definitely is quite a bit of money, but consider what that machine would actually do; it would basically do the equivalent of VISA's payment verification *multiple times over*, which is an amazing feat. Also, piano lessons cost around $50-$100 each, so if we consider a Bitcoin hobbyist, he would still pay much less for his hobby than a piano player, who'd pay about $400 per month. So it's entirely reasonable to assume that even if we had 1GB blocks, there would still be lots of people running full-nodes just so.\n\nHow about pruned nodes? Here, we only have to store the [Unspent Transaction Output Set](https://www.mycryptopedia.com/bitcoin-utxo-unspent-transaction-output-set-explained/) (UTXO set), which currently clocks in at [2.8GB](https://statoshi.info/dashboard/db/unspent-transaction-output-set). If blocks get 1000 times bigger, we can assume the UTXO set to become 2.8TB. I'll assume ordinary HDD's aren't goint to cut it for reading/writing the UTXO set at that scale, so we'll take some [NVMe SSDs](https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-1TB-NAND-NVMe-PCIe/dp/B07J2Q4SWZ/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&keywords=nvme+ssd+1tb&qid=1554632142&s=gateway&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1) for that, currently priced at $105/TB. Three of them would increase our setup by $315 to **$915**, but decrease our monthly costs. Even in the highest power state, the 3 SSDs will need only [18.6W](https://www.anandtech.com/show/12670/the-samsung-970-evo-ssd-review/8) in total, so we'll get a constant **147.6W** for the whole system.\n\nIn total, this is:\n\n* New Storage: $0/mo.\n* Bandwidth: $22.50/mo., $2.81/mo. in 2022 (same as above)\n* Electricity: $12.75/mo. (US), 32.11\u20ac/mo. (DE)\n* CPU: Initially $915\n\nIn total, this is **$35.25/mo.** in the US and **$58.57/mo.** in Germany for today's prices, or **$15.56/mo.** (US) and **$38.88/mo.** (DE) in 2022's prices. Which looks very affordable even for a non-hobbyist.\n\nE: spelling", "shit. that's a lot of money.", "@CryptoCobain Go fuck ur self mofo, unfollowed.

Even WTC after a recent 300% increase is still nearly 95% down, and it\u2019s appareebtly being used on a wide scale. Yes, XLM can fall to 5 cents, but it was at 7 cents not too long ago. Always good to put things in the broader market context. \n\nWhat\u2019s getting people frustrated is that there seem to be only a couple projects that are chasing their ATH (BNB and to a lesser extent, BAT). This is a very small portion of the market. Most of the market is still very low. I\u2019d urge everyone to be patient. I remember putting a small investment in DENT not too long ago at 24 sats but quickly pulled out when I saw the pervasive negative sentiment on their sub. It continued to make new lows afterwards. Some people will look here to decide whether or not to buy XLM. \n\nI don\u2019t want this community to fall apart simply because people have problems with the token model and think it has affected the price. Maybe it has, but XLM has still performed very well since the beginning of 2017, compared with the rest of the market. It\u2019s easy to start questioning tokenomics when something like BNB has outperformed the whole market. \n\nXLM is still one of my favorite cryptocurrencies, and I still think it has a high chance of being used in the future (not that it will, but I\u2019m still supporting it). \n\n-Victor Cobra", "Yea seeing a lot of YouTube videos on xrp last week or two.

The godforsaken inflation claim  \nStop it. Stop it now. Stop it yesterday if possible.  \nWhile the community is split among those that want to remove inflation completely and those that want to see adjustments, I think the vast majority agrees that the SDF claiming 20 million XLM per week is too much.\n2. But then holders get all the XLM and they will sell  \nNo. Whoever is still holding now must be a strong believer of the protocol. I highly doubt that an increased XLM inflation will lead to more of it finding its way to exchanges. Quite the opposite, this could be the incentive needed for users to hold on, buy more and if it has a positive effect to at least halt the selling pressure from airdrops and whatnot could be the turning point.\n3. But then XLM is a security  \nIf it's not a security at 1% it won't be a security at 10%.

In February, inflation grew the most year over the last six years. Mainly prices of basic food, energy and fuel are growing rapidly. And according to economists, it will be worse. However, prices are also rising for services. According to analysts, entrepreneurs are said to be unable to cover rising costs and must raise prices. But they are supposed to do it by little steps, so that if possible, the customer does not notice it.\n\nIf we compare last year's second year with this year, February's inflation rose almost by one percent. \"This will, of course, be reflected in an increase in household spending, as it is mostly consumables and services,\" said economist Ivan Jac.\n\nPerhaps the highest price jump is for food. Especially in vegetables, which in a month or so, averaged a quarter. The most striking is potato, whose price rose by a record 67% month on month. A 15% drop in egg prices didn't save it. The result is more expensive restaurants.\n\nAlso, holiday, culture and routine prices have increased by almost 5%. And fuel prices are also rising slightly. \"Even though fuel prices are rising at a fluctuating pace, we can still see a slight increase in their prices,\" Jac said.\n\nFor example, in Liberec fuel prices per liter are already attacking the 35-crown border. And housing costs are rising. Prices of electricity by 9%, natural gas by 3.6%, heat and hot water by 4%. The only thing that makes things cheaper is real estate prices, but only somewhere. \"Except for Prague, where there is a steady increase, in some regions prices are already falling because they have already reached a certain limit,\" the economist added.\n\nAnd we'll spend more on cutting. Hairdressers kept prices unchanged for several years. This is no longer possible now. \"Since February 1, we had to raise from 150 to 200 crowns. Everything is more expensive. Social, electricity, rent. explained the head of hairdresser Andrea Tom\u00e1\u0161kov\u00e1.\n\nAccording to economists, construction can do whatever it wants. In addition, price rises in this sector may not look so much for competition, because the market is so hungry that it cannot bring or increase the outflow of customers. \"Polystyrene by 10%, bricks by 10%, just services cannot stay the same. We have to increase the price of overall work and services and offer prices. It has no effect on demand because there are few people to work with,\" said businessman Jan Cermak.\n\nTire services and car repair shops are also going to be more expensive. However, according to the head of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises, there is no reason to panic yet. It will depend on how the economy will behave in the coming months.\n\n\"Inputs are growing, but purchasing power is growing. So far, a small increase in prices has not resulted in a negative effect of buying less. This may not go on forever because any measure of economic shock or mild instability will immediately be reflected in people's attention and start to save money, \"said Karel Havl\u00ed\u010dek, Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises of the Czech Republic.", "This type of shit has been going on with the stock market for decades #BTC #cryptocurrency @60Minutes  #HODL https://t.co/fekrjVkeMR", "@InSharpRelief @chrissmithradio All this shit was thrown at him years ago, what do u do, drag it back in to today's https://t.co/CDFMDtCJML", "Mt.

It seems to me that we are relying on node runners to do work at a loss for purely altruistic reason.  Are there ways to fairly validate that nodes are actually performing work and are not malicious, without resorting to competitive proof of work or staking? Are there known perverse incentives that pop up when rewarding nodes?  \n\nETH 2.0 seems like it will blur the distinction between nodes and miners, with Validators serving as nodes that are selected at random and are rewarded that way, so maybe this stops being important in 2.0.

I was excessively told about bitcoin by my 2 of my college  roommates who spent too much time online and decided to do some of my own research, read the whitepaper made by satoshi n and was quite fascinated by the technology, i knew it was something new and ahead of the time, but also something that could terribly fail and be another fad. although, because of how much my 2 roomies talked about it i decided why not throw a bit of money into it, and was fine with losing it or not. so fast forward, i lived in new york and was able to find a local who actually sold bulks of bitcoin through my 2 friends who previously bought off them. i was a bored college student... didnt know what i was gonna end up doing with the coins. i wanted to buy $50 worth... ended up spending a bit more than that $60-$80 i believe to get exactly 10,000 bitcoins. it was given to me on a usb which was checked on his computer to verify the bitcoins were really there before i took off. everything was good and i transferred the file from the usb to my personal laptop. now, a single bitcoin was worth a fraction of a penny so i really did not have much focus on such a small thing (at the time). ever since i put it on my laptop i really just forgot about it and did not even think about any ways for me to spend it or use it etc. and just kept it stored on my laptop. i continued to forgot about it due to me graduating college being my primary focus and that's that. then after i graduated i looked to work and did work and never really even thought to care about some stupid bitcoin i bought off some guy for a bit of money. it was just another file on my computer i didnt bother to even look at for months on months.   \n\nNow fast forward to early 2014 --- this is when i first heard about bitcoin again since i bought em, and no i did not continue to hear from them from my two roommates i was with while in college as 2010 is the year i graduated and after that we did not keep in touch. although i would assume they either lost the bitcoin they had online or are rich as fuck right now, wont find out as i have no way to contact them. anyways, so i was hanging out with a friend of mine who mentioned it to me and how the price went to $1000 and was down a bit and it would be a good time to buy some because he thought it was the future of money, it took me a few minutes to process, then it hit me and i literally almost fainted after coming to the realization i was pretty sure i had a shit ton of what he was talking about. i didnt even fully remember whether i had 1,000, 10,000, 100,000 immediately because of how much it was and how long ago i bought it but i knew it was one of those. i was so shocked and he was so confused then i just left the conversation as soon as he told me about the price to go online and check for myself if this is really the same shit i bought 4 years ago as a curious college student. it all hit me at once, i knew by the symbol and the chart which showed it going from where i bought it at less than a penny all the way to over $1000 that this was exactly what i bought and i remembered i bought 10,000 with the $60-$80 i spent and was in disbelief and euphoria over the fact that i had an absolute huge fortune waiting for me at home. this all felt unreal to me, i still remember the emotions i had going through me. now after realizing i had this fortune, i had to remember carefully where i stored these bitcoins, eventually i remembered i had it on my old personal laptop and at that moment i had a panic attack due to the fact that the laptop i had put the bitcoin on broke on me and was replaced although i figured i am not totally doomed because all i should need to get the file is the hard drive. \n\nSo here I am at home, looking for the computer only to realize that because it was broken and old and damaged, my mom told me she had thrown it away a few years back after it broke down on me since she thought it was pretty much untouched junk and expected id never need it again. at that point i literally fainted, i was angry, confused, shocked, in denial, sad, raged and so many other emotions all at once that i literally just passed out. my mom woke me back up and i ran out of the house out of anger to go have a mental breakdown in my backyard. What was supposed to be the best day of my life become by far the worst. As u can imagine, the fact that i thought i had what was between 5-10 mil at the time and then right after had that taken away from me broke my heart. i never felt the amount of pain and severe depression i felt as i did on that day. the next few months of my life were spent very badly, every day i would be reminded of what happened and how my life could of been but wasnt because my mom threw out my fortune, i am not proud of it but i started to actually resent her and be disrespectful to her often. it was a bad bad time as i was working a shitty job with low pay and living in my parents house at 25 (shout out to my useless degree) so that bitcoin would have really changed my life completely. i started going through severe depression and suicidal thoughts constantly, i really did want to kill myself knowing what had happened to me. although i tried to get through it and didnt even tell any of my friends including the one who mentioned bitcoin to me to remind me of bitcoin what happened, though they felt i was acting different and not my usual self those following months. i barely went out, i lost my job due to my sudden lack of effort from what happened, i lost friends, i isolated myself from everyone and everything including my family. i gained a lot of weight and did a lot of dumb shit im not proud of. my life was pretty horrible for the year of 2014.  \n\n\nNow fast forward to early 2015 i started to get back on my feet and try to get over the shitty year i just had. and the fact bitcoin dipped to $200ish helped with how i felt about the whole thing, though i never even considered putting another penny in it again and hoped it would just crash and die so i could keep this in the past, although as u all know this wasnt the case. now here we are in 2019, i am still broke, i still live with my parents, i am employed, but at a shitty job i hate, and have friends, but we dont talk much, and life is just not the same as it used to be. Life just hasn\u2019t been the same since 2014. Seeing bitcoin go up insane amounts all the way to nearly 20k and now still thriving at around 5k really makes me sick to the stomach, to think that i bought 10,000 at less than a penny, WHAT THE FUCK... it still hurts. i really just want to feel like this is just some very long shitty ass nightmare and wake up to reality again but i know thats not the case. i could have had the most epic fucking life and most epic story to tell of how my riches came but it never happened. my life is on a downhill, i am severely depressed and just feel so shit everyday. things are not the same as they once were and never will be the same because bitcoin has ruined my life, or maybe i allowed it to ruin my life, idk. my hopes were all high and euphoric then right after low and dreadful within 24 hours, and it has impacted me til now and will continue to weigh me down for however much longer i live.  there is really no specific moral to this story, but i just wanted to vent this to someone or somewhere finally to get my story out. this is the first and last time i will speak out publicly to anyone about this, so there you guys go. that is the story of how i lost 10,000 bitcoin. that is all.\n\ntldr; college roommates convinced me to buy bitcoin back in 2010, i ended up buying 10,000 bitcoins for $60-80 and storing them on my laptop, forget about it until 2014 when my friend randomly mentions it hitting $1k and a good buying opportunity, i rush home to look for my old broken laptop which had the bitcoins on it in the hard drive to discover my mom threw it out and the bitcoins were gone forever, i become severely depressed and affected by this and til this day cant help but think what if i had those bitcoins. life sucks, fuck bitcoin, the end.", "Grand Theft Crypto: The State of Cryptocurrency-Stealing Malware and Other Nasty Techniques https://t.co/t9GoXnGLpb https://t.co/mv64quqyqk", "Everyone is a Bitcoin Cash hater until that shit is pumping lmfao", "@eprefon Coingeek is disgusting and a terrible ambassador for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, run by a creepy soon to b https://t.co/rQ2NA8LV9g", "@MAGAJesusJTrump @realDonaldTrump How does increasing the monetary base give you inflation?

Which is, low price inflation (CPI/basket of goods etc.)\n\nMy theory is that with current technological innovations (particularly automation/online price comparisons/smarter consumer base) prices are falling (if they are measured in terms of sound money like gold - or assets - in the sense that assets prices go up while the CPI basket prices are fairly static.\n\nTherefore, even though the CPI might be positive but low, the reality is real prices should be falling. The price falls in a sense are a kind of compensation to the general population  for automation and machine replacement.\n\nSo, can we say that although CPI is positive, but very low, actually price inflation rate is higher (in keeping with monetary inflation). E.g. If there is a natural fall in real prices, then any increase in CPI above the 'CPI adjusted for tech innovation' is the real rate of inflation. Rather than being 1%, it might be 5-6% (you could even work that out against a basket of asset prices).\n\nObviously, I need a better explanation of what I'm trying to express in my own lay thinking. Anyone can refer me to some good reading? Is there a technical word to describe 'the true inflation rate that is arrived at by adjusting for tech innovation deflation' that I'm trying to describe? \n\nPerhaps it's easier to just say setting rates using CPI as a measure is fallacious and central bankers should base it on monetary inflation? To say in this way seems fine to me, but in my mind, I want that link to price inflation, because I think they think they can get away with things as long as price tags in the shops don't change too much - we should understand and fight for the benefits/compensation of 'innovation deflation'. Or in other words, a sound currency that reflects the true value of things.", "@paperghost @SheRa_Marley @MGouldthorpe1 Wait?  I thought you were a man of means and leisure.

But some people losing their shit here need to stop and think rationally about what exactly has transpired.\n\nRegardless of who he is, u/Contrarian__ has made some incredibly valuable contributions to r/btc. His claims have been consistently correct and always supported by rigorous evidence. For those who can't recall, he assembled a near-exhaustive list of CSW's lies and incompetence for all to see, and he created a sockpuppet detection tool that revealed an enormous amount of nChain/CG astroturfing in the lead up to the November split. Make no mistake, CSW is more manipulative and mendacious and a worse threat to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency than anyone on the other side of the blocksize debate. Moreover, I for one am not going to discount the truth simply because it's spoken by someone I may not like.\n\nObviously, Greg Maxwell's vision for Bitcoin differs wildly from ours. And whilst much of the history predates my involvement in BCH, it seems like he really fucked over the big blockers during the blocksize debate. From my own experience, under his account u/nullc, Maxwell has often been petty, arrogant, and more than happy to be arse. But his comments are intelligent and mostly intent on making a worthwhile point.\n\n*Perhaps it's time to realise that there's a lot of grey in the world. Maxwell can be manipulative and he can be an arsehole, and he can still write good code and make valuable contributions to a discussion that we care about.*\n\nSo, against those calling for u/Contrarian__ to be banned and whatnot \u2014 and it does look like more than a few SV trolls are taking advantage of this situation \u2014 I'd like to see Greg Maxwell continue to contribute to r/btc under his real name, in whatever capacity he wishes. I've had more than a few exchanges with u/Contrarian__ and I respected his opinions and his intellect greatly. If Maxwell's contributions continue to be valuable, good. If not, then we can call him out for his shit.\n\nI'd like to think that this community has reached a level of maturity where we can rise above the kind of tribalism that demands we downvote Maxwell simply because it's Maxwell \u2014 and the same goes for u/cobra-bitcoin. We forked off, we're building the big-block vision of Bitcoin and we should get on with proving the detractors wrong *in practice*. There's no point holding onto needless grudges and negativity. It appears that we've survived the last bubble-pop and another bull market may be around the corner. It's time for the Bitcoin Cash community to show that it has grown up and is ready to bring P2P e-cash to the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: for those who are saying both accounts should be banned for the use of sockpuppets, do you think that r/btc would have listened to Maxwell's criticism of CSW if he had presented it under his own name?

As a result, Zcash has not had its first halving yet. In a way, it\u2019s like Zcash is at the same stage as Bitcoin was back in 2011/2012. Back then, Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cinflation\u201d (aka, the amount of BTC released onto the open market as a block reward) was 50 BTC every 10 minutes. Zcash is slightly different here in that a block reward happens every 2.5 minutes, thus the reward is actually 12.5 ZEC every 2.5 minutes (which is the same as 50 ZEC every 10 minutes. 2.5 min x 4= 10 min. 12.5 ZEC per block x 4= 50 ZEC). So it still comes out to 50 ZEC every 10 minutes, which is the same as Bitcoin\u2019s inflation from 2009-2012 (again, 50 BTC every 10 min). \n\n3. Whether or not to hold ZEC depends on a variety of factors. Do you believe it will be worth more in the future?", "RT @BrankoMilan: It will be a difficult choice. \nAmerican liberals have to choose between their love of war and hate of Trump.", "I just want to say that I don't own any BSV and I sold it as fast as possible after the fork. In other words I'm not pro-BSV and I don't like CSW or CA however this delisting is setting a dangerous precedent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Binance's official motivation to delist BSV is bullshit. That exchange has no moral ground on which they can ask for BSV delisting as long as it has no issues listing all kind of scammy altcoins, not to mention running a Ponzi-lite scheme with Binance Coin (their execution is stellar but that coin should not be in top10 crypto).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPer CZ Binance's twitter on 12 Apr 2019: \"I normally don't like get involved in debates, pick sides, etc. But this is going too far. I also didn't like the fact that the fork caused BTC to drop below $6k, which caused pain to many in the industry.\" (source: [https://twitter.com/cz\\_binance/status/1116622696945602561](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1116622696945602561))\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasically Binance is punishing CSW, CA and BSV for the perceived damaged they did to BTC price value. I can only speculate but I think the moment was chosen based on BSV's reputation which is at an historic low thanks to CSW and CA retarded shenanigans.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Binance, shapeshift, blockchain, Gemini and others actions are abusive in nature and they betray a cartel mentality. As much as I don't like saying this, even a coin like BSV should be allowed to live or die based on its own merits. What Binance is doing is detrimental to the entire industry and it positions exchanges on a position of power: they can and will kill coins they don't like.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm just saying that before you celebrate this supposed \"victory of the community\" just think about the people which were gulible enough and bought BSV based on CSW and CA lies. Not all of them are BSV-shills and they are left without a way out, they will be ruined. Real lifes will be ruined because Binance found out about ethics ... when it suited their narrative.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. BSV price will fall but BSV will not die. Despite the concerted effort from all the exchanges, BSV will continue to linger in the background. \"And that's a good thing\" even for BCH. Exchanges killing coins at will is a scary prospect for the entire crypto-world. They are overstepping their responsibilities. The funny thing is that BSV might get vindicated at some point in the future :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. BCH is next. I have no doubt about it. If they are doing this to BSV which is actually quite insignificant compared to BTC then think about what they are preparing for BCH. Only in this context it's easy to understand Binance's obsession not to use the BCH ticker: they used BCC, BCHABC and BCHSV but they never used and they will never use BCH ticker because that would legitimize the BCH fork.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBottom line: Binance is a greater enemy to BCH than BSV will ever be.

That type of mining has no application in the Dentacoin community.\n\nDentacoin does recognize that the initial community of Dentacoin uses will not be global, and that the community will grow over time.  To preserve Dentacoin value in the early days of its use, only a small number of the 8 trillion coins will be released into circulation.  There is a set release schedule to accommodate the growth of the global Dentacoin community.\n\nIn this way, the basic rules of supply and demand are recognized while the true value of Dentacoin is determined by contributions to the global improvement in dental health.  As the value of that improvement is recognized and more dentists and patients join the market, more Dentacoin will be issued, growing the supply to meet the growing demand.\n\nThis is an unprecedented economic model in the world of cryptocurrencies, but it relies on very basic and well-established principals commonly practiced by developed nations.  The melding of these principals with blockchain technology and an interest in personal and global dental health has the potential to create a compelling and sustainable value proposition that will attract both investors and participants alike.", "RT @JamesMcDowallCX: Disgusting.

However, if nobody is going to take the ambition to put my plan into action, I have full intentions of educating myself on computer science over the next few years or accumulating capital so that I can put my plan into action myself. Because I think this is an important idea. I'm going to be completely honest, as an anarcho-capitalist, I recognize ONE decent argument against the free market, it may actually be the only good argument against it, wildly insufficient of a reason to abandon it imho, but still a legitimate concern: How does the free market address the problem of there being no sufficient natural incentive to give to those in need? What if demand for charity outpaces supply 100:1? And I agree that's something raw capitalism may not have an immediate answer for. That's why i've attempted to devise a system that may be able to patch this problem of social game theory and human psyche, both in re-incentivizing the good individuals as well as the selfish individuals, and any individuals in-between.\n\nFeel free to connect with me on your thoughts of this proposal, if you have any ideas for how I could put it into action faster, or if there's any specific caveats or nuances of the mechanism of action that it implements that you think need to be considered. If you are a developer or a capitalist that wants to contribute to this project, i'm 100% open to everything you could possibly throw at me. I'm much more focused on strengthening the utility case for Bitcoin Cash as well as the appeal of Voluntaryism than i am making money off of a good idea, and that is why i'm sharing this idea with you all to criticize and consider.\n\nHere is my proposal (please forgive any typos, as it's a long-sh piece that i've not done extensive spellchecking on): \n\nSmart Fundraisers: \nA system to fix the problem of market failure in charity\n\nThere is a great surplus of wealth in the world, but despite this surplus, and the otherwise manageable number of people in need of help, charity seems to always fall short of helping them completely. The system i'm proposing is a system that uses game theory to fix the problem of market failure in charity.\nThe number one reason people don't give to charity is that they believe that they do not have enough money, that their contribution would do more to hurt them then to help a cause. This problem can only be mended insofar as the individual has extra money to give at all. The second problem is the concept of fairness and individual significance. People get upset with the idea that they are likely the only one willing to donate, while everyone else sits on the sidelines because they themselves also feel insignificant. If a person knew that all that had to be done to reach a goal was for them specifically to donate some small amount, and that made the difference between a failed and a completed project, most people who considered the thought of donating to begin with would.\nThe last problem in charty, is the innate pull of selfishness. Even if we have the money, even if we know we can help, there's still one last thing pulling us back... inner greed and selfishness. Is it possible to incentivise the selfish to donate to charity? I think so. Imagine if some amount of collateral was put up in the circumstance that the project wasn't completed, and everyone who donated to the project which ended up failing would get their donations back, with guaranteed interest. If a selfish person thought that the project would fail, the selfish person might then take a risk and donate, for hopes of making interest off of it.\nMy system is a proposal to solve all of these problems and more, with a completed circle of incentives, so that there can be a market for charity.\nIncentive Structure of the Smart Fundraiser:\nEach fundraiser holds certain key properties.\n1) Guided metadata and description\n2) VAR: Collateral set\n3) VAR: Number of positions\n4) Size of positions\n5) VAR=3*4: Goal amount\n6) DYN VAR: Karma level\n7) VAR: Time limit\n8) Coin Shuffle integration\nEach smart fundraiser operates in a certain way. There is some number of quantified positions that must be filled for the SFC (Smart Fundraiser Contract) to be complete. A person can fill a partial or an excess of a position, however, the conditional refunding mechanism operates off of a trailing interest rate (firstcomers gets a sequentially higher proportion of interest). If the SFC is completed, the collateral and all filled positions is given to the fundraiser address, minus a fee of 2.5% which is surrendered to the network. If the SFC fails to meet the goal by the specified time limit, the collateral is used to subsidize the refunds of all those who participated, minus a 2.5% deduction on the collateral. There is also an opt-out \"forfeit rewards\" function, where a user can voluntarily choose to opt-out of a refund, so that no matter what, their money goes to the recipient.\nThe Trailing Interest Rate\n\nC= Collateral\nP= Positions\npN= Position Number (when you took a position)\nn= (C/P*1/P) \n\nSFC Interest Expression: ((C/P-(pN-1)*n)+(C/P-(pN-0)*n))\nSFC Interest Proof of Equation: (C/P-0n+C/P-1n)+(C/P-1n+C/P-2n)+(C/P-2n+C/P-3n)+(C/P-3n+C/P-4n)+(C/P-4n+C/P-5n)+(C/P-5n+C/P-6n)+(C/P-6n+C/P-7n)+(C/P-7n+C/P-8n)+(C/P-8n+C/P-9n)+(C/P-9n+C/P-10n) = C        \n\nExample 1:\nGiven: (C)Collateral=100\nGiven: (P)Positions=10 \nGiven: pN= 1\nn= (C/P*1/P) -> (100/10*1/10) -> 1\n\n((C/P-(pN-1)*n)+(C/P-(pN-0)*n))\n((100/10-(1-1)*1)+(100/10-(1-0)*1)\n((10-0*1)+(10-1*1))\n10+10-1\n20-1\n19\n\nThis Positiontaker will receive 19% of the collateral. This is equal to 19 units, or 190% of the position (10 units).\n\nThis is what the equation proof looks like:\n(100/10-0(1)+100/10-1(1))+(100/10-1(1)+100/10-2(1))+(100/10-2(1)+100/10-3(1))+(100/10-3(1)+100/10-4(1))+(100/10-4(1)+100/10-5(1))+(100/10-5(1)+100/10-6(1))+(100/10-6(1)+100/10-7(1))+(100/10-7(1)+100/10-8(1))+(100/10-8(1)+100/10-9(1))+(100/10-9(1)+100/10-10(1)) = 100        \n(10+9)+(9+8)+(8+7)+(7+6)+(6+5)+(5+4)+(4+3)+(3+2)+(2+1)+(1+0) =100\n19+17+15+13+11+9+7+5+3+1 =100\n100=100\n\nExample 2: Let's use some weirder numbers, just to make sure the formula is valid.\nGiven: C= 12345\nGiven: P= 4\nn= (C/P*1/P) -> 3086.25*0.25 -> 771.5625\n((C/P-(pN-1)*n)+(C/P-(pN-0)*n))\n((12345/4-(1-1)*771.5625)+(12345/4-(1-0)*771.5625))+((12345/4-(2-1)*771.5625)+(12345/4-(2-0)*771.5625))+((12345/4-(3-1)*771.5625)+(12345/4-(3-0)*771.5625))+  ((12345/4-(4-1)*771.5625)+(12345/4-(4-0)*771.5625)) = 12345\n(3086.25-0+3086.25-771.5625)+(3086.25-771.5625+3086.25-1543.15)+(3086.25-1543.15+3086.25-2314.6875)+(3086.25-2314.6875+3086.25-3086.25) = 12345\n12345 = 12345 \n\nOf course, these collateral amounts are highly disproportionate to the number of available positions. Either this would equate to poor marketing as a result of the asked amount being too high, or trying to incentivise people to participate past the necessary amount to incentivise them. Realistically, given a Fundraiser goal of 1000, you would be more likely to put 10 up as collateral with 100 positions, instead of putting up 100 for 10 positions (a person partcipating in the latter could almost double their investment, which is slightly ridiculous). With this mechanism of rewarding the firstcomers of a failed SFC, it incentivises people to participate immediately, as opposed to the normal action of \"waiting to see where it goes, then deciding after you've thought it through\". Those that act fast without second thinking pitching in too much are more likely to get rewarded highly for a failed SFC.\n\nGuided Metadata and Description\n\nEach smart fundraiser starts off by asking the fundraiser-starter some basic questions about the nature of the fundraiser, including proof of the claims made therein. Each fundraiser requires or asks for a body of text, a picture of the person making the fundraiser, pictures of relevant documents and/or bodily injuries, contact information for the individual, and/or a video of the person explaining the problem. After submission, the fundraiser is not allowed to be changed, and cancelling the fundraiser deducts 2.5% from the set collateral.\n\nFour Phases of Execution\n\nEach SFC exists in four separate stages. The time limits for each one is adjusted by the person creating the SFC, but a default setting might look like six hours for the first, six hours for the second, three days for the third, and a week for the fourth.\nPhase One: Community Review- In Phase One, members of the Smart Charity Community (SCC) will be incentivised to participate in contract review. Each SFC will have a small list of requirements, and members of the SCC will vote positive or negative on the satisfaction of these requirements (which is revealed to the SFC starter before creating the SFC). Different members of the community may hold a different voting weight, determined by how much Karma they have. Voting weight is determined by the decimal magnitude of your Karma.  A person with 1 karma would have a VW of 1, a person with 10 Karma would have a VW of 2, a person with 100 Karma would have a VW of 3, and so on. A person with -10 Karma would have a VW of 0.1, a person with -100 karma would have a VW of 0.01, and so on. With this voting weight, a person recieves or loses a karma point every time they vote on objective admissions. If a person votes in favor of the majority on an objective admission, they gain points based on the level of VW they have. If they vote against the majority, they'll lose that point instead. There are also a few subjective admissions, where a person recieves a karma point for voting no matter what (based on VW).\nThe overall points gained or lost in the review phase will carry over to the next three phases as an immutable part of the contract. It will also add to or subtract the karma of the individual's account after the contract is completed. But this is not the only time voting on this SCF is allowed, in fact, it is allowed in all four phases. There is a sentiment vote where every individual regardless of karma or VW gets to vote positive or negative on a SFC. Phase two voting is allowed and is added as a second layer to the already existing total, in Phase three voting is also allowed with the same parameters, and in the final phase each vote is given a weight of ten multiplied by VW. Karma is altered after the fact.\nQuestions that might be asked in phase one of each member of the SCC might be as follows:\n1) OA: Is the SFC coherent and legible?\n2) OA: Is the SFC about helping someone in need?\n3) OA: Is there a clear picture of the individual holding up a piece of paper that lists the date, name of his project, and his name?\n4) OA: Was some form of contact information given at the start?\n5) OA: If documentation or proof of injury is relevant, are pictures of such provided?\n6) SA: Do you personally feel like this project is good/necessary?\n\nPhase Two: Investor Speculation- This phase is set aside to reinforce the collateral of a SFC by incentivising people to invest in a project. The way it works is simple, a person stakes some money as reinforcing collateral, and if the SFC succeeds, all the investors get a proportional chunk of 50% of the 2.5% (or variably altered) fee as well as a refund on their money. If one person puts in $10 and another puts in $5, and that was all that was invested, the person that put in $10 would get 2/3rds of the halved fee. The consequence is that if the SFC fails, then their investment is mixed in with the collateral and redistributed to the positiontakers. The purpose for this phase is to help people that have little to no money for setting aside collateral, and obviously this would be a problem for many. Higher SFC fees on a SFC incentivise investors to come in. It is in the investor's best interest to choose good projects that will succeed, as anything else could hurt them via failure.\n\nPhase Three: Contract Execution- This is the phase where people can actually donate to SFC (and speculate on them if they may). Each SFC has a goal, a certain number of positions, and a size for each position, as well as collateral, a karmic disposition, and a predefined time limit.  All of the details and metadata of the project is included for everyone to see, and people are free to send their bitcoin cash to the address provided. All funds are sent through a coinmixing service so that the blockexplorers cannot be used to cheat on the speculative aspect of the fundraisers. You're free to fill partial or excessive positions, but partial positions do not qualify for a potential refund, and if the excess doesn't fill a whole new position, it is not refunded either. Also, partial positiontakings are calculated at the end of a SFC (as opposed to their chronological appearance on the blockchain), and any extra is kept with the SFC. As soon as a SFC is completed, it will finish Phase Three immediately and leave to Phase Four. Its still physically possible to donate to the fundraisers, but they won't appear on the site where you'd normally find them. Donating more to the fundraisers would just redirect the funds to the owner of the fundraiser directly.\nIf a SFC has a net-negative Karma after the time limit or position limit is reached, all the funds sent therein will be seized and absorbed as if it were completely consumed by fees on all fronts. This disincentivises investing in scams for hopes of speculating on and scamming scammers, and disincentivises scammers because they will lose their collateral even if they would have otherwise been successful. It also forces projects to be clean, legible, and as professional as possible.\n\nPhase Four: Communty Follow-Up Review- After a SFC is finished, the individual that started it is given a window of time to use their funds to do whatever they said they were going to do with them. After that prespecified time limit is met, the postexecuted SFC shows up again in the P4 column of the site and awaits the added metadata. The individual will be notified via email and address dusting to remember to add the metadata before the time limit is up. After the time limit is up, people are allowed to upvote or downvote the postexecuted SFCs. If a SFC turned out to be a scam or dishonest and unprevented effort, the user can be punished with bad karma. On the contrary, wholesome results will lead to positive karma, which has financial benefits.\n\nKarma and Economy\n\nThere is a built-in economy on Smart Charity. At the end of every month, a 0.2083% compound inflation (2.5% annual) of all SCC coins are distributed to the members of the community proportionally, based on net karma. At the end of every week, the revenue of the Smart Charity site is distributed proportionally to every SCC coin holder. This is 100% of the revenue, and doesn't have any other built in fees (besides the fact that the creators of the site may have a relatively large percentage of the coins in holding). Over time profit distribution will become more fair and decentralized.\nThe fees on the SFCs start off as 2.5%, but the user can actually raise or lower these fees to their complete preference. Higher fees incentivise investors and put your SFC at the top of the site, lower fees could bury or even hide your SFC from normal view. The fees will always be a market phenomemon and there are no forced fees to be extracted from any charity efforts. Except there is a consistent 2.5% on all collateral surrendered to the positiontakers of a failed SFC. Failed SFCs are still viewable to people to be invested in, but go in their own column away from the active ones.\n\nAdditional features:\n\nThere will eventually be a feature where you can send funds, and the Smart Fundraiser protocol will automatically and randomly donate to various projects based on a combination of Karma and low investment flow. It will also let you split up money multiple ways. The funds sent are nonrefundable. \nIn addition to the former, there will eventually be a feature to log one of your bitcoin wallets and extract a percentage of all recieved funds to donate to random projects. The percentage would be set to whatever you wanted it to be. This would custodialize and lower the security of your bitcoin wallet, however.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe this protocol would effectively lessen the scope of the market failure problem of charity, and possibly even eliminate it with enough monetary volume. People who gamble all their money away don't usually give to charity, and these kind of people will be drawn into the SCC to try to make money off of the poorer and less popular ends of all the projects, resulting in some instances where selfish individuals and gamblers actually serve to benefit someone in need. The rigid structure and mechanism of the protocol will also help spot and eliminate scams sent into the ecosystem, and ensure a productive healthy environment for everybody in it. \n\n\n", "EOS is planning on lowering the annual inflation rate following the result of an official poll held among the holde https://t.co/wNrKb7ubK1", "@jimmysong Its a list of variables the horrible money policy of the fed who nobody trusts!

He introduces his theory in the first sentence of his abstract, \u201cMoney gains value through use.\u201d^(\\[1\\])\n\nThe rate of money use is termed [velocity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/velocity.asp)^(\\[2\\]) and Craig Wright contends that increased velocity increases the value of money.^(\\[1\\])  \n\nSo, does money gain value through use?\n\nNo, however use of a currency could be positively correlated value, but that correlation comes from increased demand for the currency since the currency may be more likely to be useful for purchases and trades if it is commonly used. \n\nIncreases in velocity will actually ***decrease*** the value of money. This effect is affirmed by the quantity theory of money equation (also called the equation of exchange), which Craig Wright considers in his paper: P = MV/Y, where Velocity (V) varies directly with [Price Level](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price_level.asp) (P) (a variable inversely related to the value of money).^(\\[3\\]) \n\nP is a measure of the level of prices in an economy. Increases in P over time = inflation and decreases in P over time = deflation.^(\\[4\\]) Money is becoming more valuable when P decreases (deflation) and less valuable when P increases (inflation), so clearly P varies inversely with the value of money. However, Craig Wright\u2019s paper falsely implies that P varies directly with the value of money. \n\nNote: Craig Wright\u2019s error may have come from him mislabeling P as \u201cprice of money\u201d even though he initially correctly labels P as \u201cprice level\u201d in the \u201cVelocity of Money\u201d section. \n\nThis analysis supports [Paul Sztorc\u2019s notes on the paper](https://twitter.com/Truthcoin/status/888780567004803072).^(\\[5\\])  \n\nReferences\n\n\\[1\\][https://nchain.com/app/uploads/2017/07/SegWit-and-the-illusion-of-scale.pdf](https://nchain.com/app/uploads/2017/07/SegWit-and-the-illusion-of-scale.pdf)\n\n\\[2\\][https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/velocity.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/velocity.asp)\n\n\\[3\\]\u201cMacroeconomics\u201d \u2013 by Charles I.

I am urologist so I did not follow all of Mastering BTC, but I did get the main points. I have been reading, following, and using BTC for about 9 months now.\n\nHere on Twitter there is so much deception within the community. I have a question and honestly do not know of a good source other than you because people are so attached to their own coin.\n\nHere is my concern/question: I have been primarily investing in and using BTC and think the coin meets your 5 criteria you laid out in the \u201cblockchain or bullshit\u201d talk from South Africa. The security and Store of value is untouchable. 2nd layer scaling looks promising. But BCH seems to provide the alternative which is on chain scaling. I suspect a few coins will emerge with good use cases over the next decade. It seems like BCH meets your 5 criteria as well with the only concern being the centralization issue - which could change with time. As I think about this issue...it doesn\u2019t seem wrong to support, use, and invest in both? Litecoin, I guess, presents another option for on chain scaling? I only have used and invested in BTC...bought a small amount of LTC once but converted it. I read about BTC, BCH, ethereum and litecoin. I do not have time to research the other coins. I approach you with this because it is hard to find a reliable source in this space. I do not trust some of the people promoting BCH...but do think Roger Ver makes great points.... If you have time to answer/comment I will not take your response as investment advice and would never, under any circumstance, make your response public or known to anybody other than me.... I have posted this issue on my Twitter but got no responses because low followers.. Have a wonderful day. Thanks for all you do in the crypto space and elsewhere.\n\nI know this is old news for most of you guys. The \"scaling\" debate. I have watched Roger Ver debate so many people and to be honest, he always wins. His points are solid. \"Do you want to be able to buy coffee with bitcoin?\" He goes on and on. He tweeted today about making the fees so high as to drive people off chain, etc.\n\nWhen I got into crypto I did my research, did the reading and continue to do so. One person, early on...said \"never buy BCH. Some \"newbs\" make this mistake. So I have been against it from day 1, but cant help but think to myself that maybe BCH has a role. Maybe it will be a coin to emerge from the pack.\n\nHelp me understand. What am I missing?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I own NO BCH. I am not trolling the BTC forum. I consider myself a BTC maximalist at this point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE 1: SHOCKED. [r/BITCOIN](https://www.reddit.com/r/BITCOIN) BANNED THIS POST.

That gives  an annual inflation rate of  8.91% when compounded (circulating supply  of 41.7 Billion). In addition, early adopters and founders such as McCaleb, and Larsen, etc. are selling  large amounts at times, so XRP inflation (as in XRP hitting the market) is between 11 to 13% a year right now, and when Jed is firing on all cylinders the number could theoretically go even higher (when XRP has a daily volume of 1 Billion, which happens, Jed McCaleb can sell 1.5% of that according to the publicly known contract, which equals 15 million XRP on a daily basis).\n\n(I have not added Ripple's programmatic sales to this calculations as I'm not in complete understanding of what this entails).\n\nPlease let me know where I'm going wrong.", "@PeterSchiff Isn't it that fiat money that sits in the pocket is thrown away slowly but surely by inflation and neg https://t.co/jSWV9jPixT", "Realize this is a little off topic am posting here as I would guess a fair number of people competent to answer may be found here.  \n\nOne area that has become fairly centralized is information indexing/search.  There is also a high barrier to entry to create a competent product as the computation power is high.  Could mining be tied to crawling/indexing the internet incentivizing the process?  I would imagine the simplest approach might be something along the lines of requiring half the compute power of the miner to go towards indexing the internet before allowing hashing for block solving.  While I am really out of my element, perhaps there might even be some way of encrypting a previously found web page such that when the page is indexed again it solves the block thus allowing all compute power to go towards indexing information.  One downside I see is that some pretty nasty stuff might be dredged up which puts one again in the position of a gatekeeper needing to police what information might be obtainable, that might be handled be third parties.  Still it would be nice to have a distributed approach to indexing information on the internet.  Maybe, I am missing something and it would be very technically difficult to accomplish, maybe been tried before or is currently being worked on.

Money was \u2018invented\u2019 to solve the inefficiency within trading.\n\nIf you grow and trade apples and you want a banana, so you go to the guy who trades bananas but he doesn\u2019t want your apples and he instead wants an orange. So you go to the guy who trades oranges but he doesn\u2019t want apples he wants grapes. So you go to the guy who sells grapes and he wants your apples so you trade it with him. Then you just trade your way back to getting the banana you wanted. That\u2019s problematic and quite annoying. So why not create a currency which can be used to exchange goods. So the Apple guy sells his apples for 1 dollar each and the grape guys buys one, which the Apple guy will use to buy the banana he wanted.\n\nNow I understand the whole money is a medium of exchange, store of value, and a unit of account. I also understand how bitcoin sort of fits in to those requirements with some edges jutting out. \n\nHowever everyone mining bitcoin is not generating any goods to attain it. Your computer is burning through GPUs and high levels of energy to \u2018mine\u2019 bitcoins. But in reality, it\u2019s solving a bunch of math problems that don\u2019t generate any goods to be sold. All the bitcoin \u2018millionaires\u2019 didn\u2019t sell anything or do anything valuable to which someone would pay money for. \n\nIt\u2019s like someone one day took dog shit and cat shit and mixed it together and said this is worth M O N E Y. So after several years, the dog and cat shit combo became popular, thanks to the internet. And wow! People suddenly started saying the dog and cat shit combo is now worth 20K. Thanks to hundreds of thousands of followers clinging to the dog and cat shit combo to make them millionaires in the far future, they started mixing as much dog and cat shit as they possibly could. And imagine their shock when they attempt to buy something with a bag of dog-cat shit combo and they get kicked out. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the same as gold because gold was the original universal currency. Everyone considered gold valuable since the discovery of it. \n\nOut of all the reasons about how bitcoin is bullshit, this reason is the one I can\u2019t get over.", "RT @saifedean: Fiat money allows wars with no real cost to governments, which makes detestable bloodthirsty chickenhawk scum like @MaxBoot", "if you want to make passive money from #cryptocurrency or #bitcoin check this free ebook by my buddy, shit rocks - https://t.co/esaNY6WF4N", "@NBCTheVoice Hate that Adam is leaving but understand...

Each unit of currency they print *ex nihilo* steals that printed value from all holders of currency, called \"inflation.\" Venezuela is only the latest example of inflation by the State gone awry.\n\nPredictably, the state and its allies in the economics profession constantly propagandize the people to think that \"a little bit of inflation is a good thing.\" As if stealing from everyone just a little bit could be a good thing. \n\nThis year they're stealing only a trillion dollars in wealth from US citizens in the form of inflation. (It would be interesting to see what fraction of world production is taken by all states in total.)\n\nA trillion here, a trillion there, pretty soon you're talking real money. Keynes said \"in the long run we're all dead,\" but we're living in Keynes's long run today.\n\nThe State's allies in this sly theft on the grandest scale are the [banksters,](https://youtu.be/-DdfLtOrBPU) which can literally create money from thin air, authorized by law to do so.\n\nThis is what the vision of bitcoin cash stands against, corruption and exploitation of all, the greatest mass transfer of wealth in world history, from all to the State and its allies.\n\nThis is why some economists, not inured to State control of currency, predicted decades ago [the emergence of a digital currency](https://youtu.be/6MnQJFEVY7s) that would put an end of these abuses by the nation State.\n\nOf course there are many people that don't give a damn about making the world a better place, and have no respect for our desire to hold BCH to the end, no matter what, because it represents the best hope for a free and decentralized global currency for all.\n\nWe really mean it when we express sympathy for the poor of the 3rd world, who in great part remain poor because they cannot gain access to the institutional financial services that would allow them to earn far more than they can now.\n\nHow many are dying today, and have died, in Venezuela because of State current-abuse. So many lives changed forever there regardless, over 3 million people have fooled Venezuela, most permanently, because of currency-abuse.\n\nCryptocurrency has the power to keep that from ever happening again.\n\nAnd this isn't even a new problem.\n\nIt [happened in Zimbabwe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe?wprov=sfla1) from the 1990's to 2009 where \"Zimbabwe's peak month of inflation is estimated at 179.6 billion percent in mid-November 2008.\"\n\n[Hyperinflation happened in Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_the_Weimar_Republic?wprov=sfla1)between the two world wars.\n\nAnd [hyperinflation happened in France several times in a row](https://mises.org/library/revolutionary-france%E2%80%99s-road-hyperinflation) shortly before Napoleon came to power. Napoleon hated inflation so much by then that he paid his soldiers in gold and refused to use fiat.\n\nNot only that but Henry the 8th began watering down even silver coinage.\n\nAnd the Romans did the same to the gold denari, contributing to the fall of Rome.\n\nThis problem goes back ***thousands of years*** and only now do we have the ultimate solution in cryptocurrency and crypto-anarchy.\n\nYou don't have to care about all of these ideas to be part of the BCH community, but you should know that it is awareness of literally ***millennia*** of currency abuse by State powers that drove the creation of cryptocurrencies in the first place, and why so many of us consider it vitally important to spend our time and treasure making sure the world gets to choose a real cryptocurrency that cannot be corrupted or destroyed by the powers that be.\n\nBTC's corruption and takeover was a massive blow against our efforts, but it is not the end, not remotely.\n\nAnd that is another reason why BCH is an important and leading cryptocurrency, because the community that cares about these issues, about the history of State currency-abuse, have gelled around BCH as the standard bearer for our hopes of a would currency that States cannot manipulate.\n\nUltimately that makes BCH a better currency for everyone, whether you're aware of this history and these motivations or not. Because no one likes to lose value and savings, whether they are told it's for their own good or not. \n\nCertainly no one likes hyperinflation, and hyperinflation appears to be the ultimate end of every fiat currency.\n\nJust wanted to toss that out there for anyone who may be unaware of these issues.\n\nIf you want more information along these lines, seek out [\"What Has Government Done To Our Money\" by Rothbard.](https://mises.org/library/what-has-government-done-our-money)", "@vegardwikeby @blockchain @krakenfx @ShapeShift_io The rest I couldnt give a shit about, but @ShapeShift_io I use https://t.co/3UuyHuqvd6", "So in a time of apparent fiat money (but is inflation targeting a modified form of commodity money), it seems that https://t.co/eqGzhiqfY7", "Come back on twitter to see..\nAlbion still Potless.\nVilla fans still deluded.\nBlouse up shit creek without a paddle https://t.co/cyOe4SC0k1", "No, what sets a bad precident is suing random people on Twitter for calling bullshit when they smell it.", "Fixed: Some Online Poker Sites Screw Players, But Blockchain Can Un-Fix TheGame https://t.co/R8WyP5yjUP", "Dont get taken for an unpleasant ride.\n\n$crsm stay smart and go with @car_smartt \n\nQuality and safety is the top pr https://t.co/yjFINbOLOR", "#YoungandtheRestless.\n\nThis Annoys Me To No End, They're Recasting Chelsea Lawson.

I'm definitely in favor of the idea in principle, but we're talking about altering the pre-existing social contract on a live chain. What right do developers have to introduce a very subjective and experimental mechanism to tax the community? Who's to blame for the lack of funding, in the first place?\n\nIt appears to me if the distribution of ether were more egalitarian  from the start, more developers would have received their fair share. That is, if these reserves were prudently spent and managed by the leadership, there should be no need for this contentious retroactive tax policy. Do we have any actual evidence this is the case? Have public funds really been improperly disbursed? Or is it jealously, fear of inadequacy, unrealistic expectations, and so on, that's motivating this?\n\nIf the funds were unfairly hoarded and kept out of the hands of the developers, then perhaps this is a legitimate move, but I don't believe that case has been made in any convincing and public way. On the other hand, if the developer's are simply plotting to extract as much as they can from the community (by incrementally ratcheting such a value extraction mechanism), then obviously we're going to resist. People will spin this into a \"developer bailout\" and they'll have a real point (unlike the DAO hard fork).

Censorship, centralisation, absolute power in the hands of the big players (the banks from the ancient time)..

If we continue that way we can see how exchanes delist BITCOIN by reasons as \"untrusted\", non KYC or whatever. Dont they tend to devaluate it in order to get higher their own exchange-coins (aka BANK-COINS!), to CONTROL the market AND the CUSTOMERS as far as it can.\n\nThe problem is that the big part of cryptoadopters are some kind of \"investors\", \"traders\", profit-hunters.

Gold is used as a store and transfer of wealth everywhere in the world. \n\nThe dollar is inflationary. All fiat is inflationary. Sure fixed inflation is better like xlm has but its still theft. \n\nInflation is essentially saying you r1$ is worth 1% less every year/ 1xlm is worth 1% less every year. \n\n\nThere is zero need for inflation in a fair market. Why even bother with xlm if every $ invested will have 1% less value every year? \n\n\nIf im missing something correct me. And yeah i under stand compounding interest but if its meant as motivation to spend instead of hold 1% will do nothing because realistically the common man does not spend <1% of their wealth per year.

Stop spreading lies. Theres only a handful of people who", "In 2005-06, I was a freshman in college.  You know what I did for money?  I was a valet attendant at a golf club.  I parked cars.  Nice cars.  I made like $120-150/day easy.  It was a good job.  A buddy of mine, who was also a valet, got a nice car too.  A Lexus, with leather seats and chrome rims.  It was tacky as hell by today's standards, but we were idiots.\n\nWe weren't satisfied with $150/day.  You know what we did?  We printed business cards.  A chauffeur service.  It was totally illegal, and totally against golf club rules, but we didn't give a fuck, because we were stupid.  We charged flat rates.  You want to go to the airport?  $35.  You want a ride to the stadium?  $40.  The nightclub at the beach?  $50.  We gave cards to all the guests.  When my buddy was working his shift, I'd drive.  When I was working, he'd drive (my car sucked, so his Lexus was all we had).  Soon we were making $300-350/day.  It was Uber before smartphones.\n\nThen one day the supervisor at the golf club was walking by the ashtray garbage bins near the entrance and he found one of the business cards on the floor.  It had our names and phone numbers on it.  He was pissed.  He called us both into the office and told us what we were doing was illegal, and against the club rules.  He fired us.\n\nThe irony of the situation is that Uber did the same exact shit we were doing.  They were illegal, too.  They had no license to operate a taxi service, and their service was against all municipal rules and ordinances.  They just fucking shoved their way in and did it, and asked questions later.  They had more balls, technology, and money than we did.\n\nSo how does Bitcoin fit into this story?  Right now Bitcoin is hard to buy.  The reason is because the operators of these kiosks and bitcoin exchanges like Coinbase are giant pussies.  That's the truth.  I went to Coinstar's website to find a kiosk near my area and there were none.  Imagine that.  They're only placed in the worst mini-marts, in the worst neighborhoods in town.  If they put a Coinstar BCH buying kiosk in a major thoroughfare in my area they would rake in the cash.  All they have to do is convince a major mall owner or a supermarket company to say yes.  That should be easy, because money talks.  I went a few days ago to deposit money in Coinbase to buy BCH and they're holding it for 10 days.  Fucking cowards.  They're scared of fraud, but what they don't realize is that they're scaring away all their customers.  At some point they need to put a giant neon sign that says \"COINBASE.  BUY BITCOIN WITH CASH, RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW,\" in giant blue neon letters, in front of the biggest mall in town.  \n\nThat's what needs to happen.\n\nAm I right?", "RT @LordBrunson: #Bitcoin cash full of shit... it was at 3k when I tried to buy then it hit 8k...then back to 3.

I don\u2019t know you. We are complete strangers, so the words that I\u2019m about to type may not ring true to some, but maybe a few.\n\nIt feels bad. It feels like shit. There is no denying that. The price of XRP being so stagnant does hit hard. You, me, and everyone else that own this coin are in it for the money. That is the end goal. There is nothing to be ashamed about this, as we all want to gain wealth in this darned economy. So when the price isn\u2019t moving, and things aren\u2019t going the way we expect them, we get frustrated. This is normal. \n\nI understand that some want to hide this frustration, to appear strong. And I mean this is the internet, what better place to do it?\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to get at is that let these feelings go over you. In your real life, in your mind, do not ignore these thoughts, these feelings. Don\u2019t try to bury them deep. That\u2019s not healthy. Instead, acknowledge them. When they come, look at these emotions and feel them. They\u2019re not here forever, it\u2019ll pass.\n\nMany people say that investing and emotions do not mix. This is very true. In this current state, there\u2019s a very real risk that you might be thinking of jumping ship. And that\u2019s fine, honestly. But only after you\u2019ve analyzed the situation, looked at the different outcomes. These outcomes will be different for everyone, but it\u2019s still necessary to think about them.\n\nWhat good does it do me to hold a coin, any coin, and hope that it makes money, only for it to stay stagnant. You might think \u201cdoesn\u2019t do me any good at all\u201d. But if you\u2019re thinking this at the heat of the moment, when looking at charts and reading threads, and then you *act* on these emotions and turn them into actions, then you are, my friend, being manipulated (to a certain extent).\n\nSo, yes. Look at the charts. Read the threads. Get angry, or frustrated. But do not act at that moment. That is you letting your emotions take control of your actions.\n\nInstead, after getting frustrated, sit back, and tell yourself that you\u2019ll get back to this when you have more time. Do your duties of the day and once you get back home, sit down for a couple of minutes and analyze the situation from a perspective that is void of erratic emotions. \n\nOnly then should you carry out an act, wether that be to hold, sell, etc.\n\nSorry for the long read, but I felt that this was necessary to say. I see many people getting antsy on here (now imagine what all the lurkers are thinking about!). Hopefully this post will remind some that taking a moment to rationalize a situation (any situation) will usually be beneficial to you.\n\nTo end this, I want to say that I\u2019ve been a lurker on this thread for quite some time. I love it. It has its ups and downs, but compared to other crypto threads I honestly feel like we\u2019ve got a neat, close community here. And posting about your fears and such on here shouldn\u2019t be downvoted. While many may think that they\u2019re trying to spread FUD, you never know a persons full situation, let alone on the internet. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty out there worried about the current events surrounding us, but honestly, let\u2019s take a step back and look at the big picture.\n\nFeels better, doesn\u2019t it? Zooming out let\u2019s us see the end goal. And while some may call that a far fetched way of dreaming, it\u2019s the dreams and goals of people that change the things around us. If you don\u2019t have people thinking out of the box, or disrupting a current way of doing things, the world would stand still. Innovations would stop, nothing new would be done.

It seems far more sincere and even-handed. So, bravo and thank you for the tone of your messaging. With that said, there still appears to be a great deal of subjectivity involved in the current moderation practices. For instance, I find it very problematic to claim /r/Ethereum aims to be a place \"...void of hate, vitriol, insults, slurs, threats of violence, witch hunts\". I believe this perpetuates a form of pseudo-common sense that will be used as justification to police people's free speech. That is, I don't believe the moderators should be using their subjective sense of what is 'acceptable', 'civil', and 'polite' as a means of ideological regulation. Your idea of 'hatred' and 'vitriol' may just be other people's sense of satire and political dissent. Your idea of a 'witch hunt' may be a tool to protect people who are far from innocent. You get my point, I hope. All this is a very dangerous, implicitly authoritarian slippery slope for the moderators to go down and I would really hope this community can rise above this kind of veiled social control.\n\n>\"Ideally, if there is a large calling for a moderator to be removed, the moderator in question will voluntarily step down. Doing so should not be interpreted as the moderator agreeing with or admitting fault to the claims presented, but simply that the moderator is willing to sacrifice their position in order to avoid further conflict and distraction\"\n\nThe calls to remove Ryan Zurrer as a moderator have been significant. They represent a wide variety community view points, which many would argue have been fair and respectful, on the whole. Whether he wishes to recognize it or not, it's the community will to remove him as a moderator on /r/ethereum on account of the fact that he has a very obvious preferential commitment to Polkadot and the Web3 Foundation, which many of us consider to be misaligned with the Ethereum ecosystem. Ryan's refusal to step down in a responsible way has taxed people's patience and good will. It does injury to the community's voice and makes us appear weak and subservient to elitists. In my sincere opinion, this will to remove Ryan is not a product of maximalism or malicious intent. Many of us embrace a radical and freedom-loving diversity, but there's only so much open mindedness we can accommodate before our brains fall out of our skulls.", "@DetroitPistons @Keith_Langlois Dont ruin a smart offseason w a bad Russell Westbrook trade.

But as of today, I won't be doing that anymore. What I used to love about BTC is no longer a reality. It's no longer the peer-to-peer electronic cash system being described in the white paper.\n\nWhat took you so long to realize this you might ask? Well, being around Bitcoin and using it since 2010/2011 made me hate the idea of forks. If it wasn't BTC, I didn't consider it to be Bitcoin despite being better in many ways. The BTC community bashing Bitcoin Cash whenever they can didn't make it easier either. It even got so bad that I've been wearing Blockstream merch for the last couple of months. (Yes, even as of writing this)\n\nI suppose it's better to realize it late rather than being a stubborn BTC maximalist hoping for the mess that's Lightning to improve. The usability of BCH on-chain is so much better than BTC on-chain. Something that I also like about Bitcoin Cash is the community. You don't start censoring people and call them scammers as soon as they have another view on things. \n\nLet's spend 2019 improving Bitcoin Cash and its adoption. I wish the BTC community the best of luck improving Lightning as on-chain is barely viable anymore.\n\nThank you to all the developers and supporters that makes Bitcoin Cash so great!", "@HealthWarrior1 So it pulls every from BSV blockchain?

For this to become law, it must be similarly introduced, or reconciled, into the Senate,\npass both chambers and signed by the President. Could be quick (6 months) if introduced into a larger package of bills, or slow, or never. \n\nThis proposed bill is amazingly liberal, about as much as we could hope for in our wild dreams (except sale or exchange of tokens for tokens is tax-free only up to $600 of gains; this should be unlimited; only exit to fiat should be taxed IMHO. Makes accounting, reporting, and compliance simple).\n\n\n**Summary of bill:**\n\n* 1) Allows ICO (unless the SEC sends a letter of notification to an ICO making an offer that the SEC has determined the offer is a security, and the ICO must close up shop within 90 days and refund as much as practicable). Notice that the SEC must proactively label an ICO a securities offer. The ICOs do not have to apply to the SEC for anything and must be let alone, otherwise; \n\n* 2) Digital tokens are defined as \u201ca representation of economic, proprietary, or access rights stored on a computer\u201d (read as virtual, digital PROPERTY. Property classification seems to suggest that the CFTC and FTC regulations do not apply to rights in PROPERTY);\n \n* 3) Tokens are classed as NOT securities, unless so determined by the SEC. (Opinion: Very likely the SEC will be taken on a long court fight if this happens, depending on the context); \n\n* 4) Preempts all state laws except with respect to fraud. (Opinion: Criminality, thankfully, is not given any shield, and hopefully some bad actors go to prison and teach the other inmates about cryptography so they can have skills when they leave); \n\n* 5) The most striking thing is the bill amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and appears to ALLOW exchanges that offer CUSTODIAL or FIDUCIARY SERVICES (read staking) to get a banking license;\n\n* 6) Bill seems to suggest that use of individual retirement accounts for purchases of tokens shall not be considered \u201cdistribution,\u201d meaning that you are not taxed on it, but it is considered an equivalent investment of your retirement funds as if you were to purchase gold (effective as of 01Jan17);\n\n* 7) Gains on sale or exchange of one virtual currency for another is not taxable unless the gains exceed $600 (indexed for inflation, and effective as of 01Jan17). \n\n\nThis bill is very pro-crypto. Please help push it through Congress. Share the importance of the bill in all crypto channels, and ask the entire crypto-community to support it. This law is the most liberal,\nforward-thinking law I have seen in crypto, beyond anything so far considered or passed by other countries. If this bill becomes law, it will be a template for many other countries and help make laws uniform, maybe even competitive. \n\n\nYou can also help by signing the petition a group of Tezos Community members posted in June, 2018. Signing allows you to send the petition directly to Congress people. I think there is a small fee to send the message directly. If you are outside the US, send to Congress as indicated at the bottom of the petition.\n\n\nhttps://www.petition2congress.com/ctas/manifesto-on-defense-blockchain", "RT bitcointe : TURKISH  HYPER INFLATION, BITCOIN , Blockchain and The Failing BANKS!

It's got the resiliency of running for 10 years with only minor hiccups.  It is the strongest most secure and decentralized blockchain due to the hashrate needed to successfully do a 51% attack.  It is the most willl known digital currency so it will likely be the first one people will adopt at least for a stir of value. When it comes to more risk averse institutional players, I'm leaning towards them choosing bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, political and social unrest, and a central authority having control of a monetary system.  \n\nIf your looking for more risk, the upside to cardano could be huge if it's successful. Cardano is a fledgling and it'll take years before it's vision is realized if they can do it. It's mostly trying to be a better ethereum. Faster, more secure, and more decentralized. They also want to make interoperability possible with many different chains. They are trying to help bring people into crypto. They are putting a lot of developing countries as the battleground due to their inability to have stable banking/ financial systems.  They are trying to combat the problem with people having no identification or unable to get bank accounts for whatever reason. They want to first help people who are at a financial disadvantage due to their location to allow then to easily come into the new financial world.  Cardano is a slow moving project but they eventually want their currency to be the best choice of all digital assets.\n\n There's a lot of competition, however Charles Hoskinson is a previous ethereum co-creator who saw pitfalls in that system so he's trying to create a better one.  One thing that is needed to be successful is a huge developer community. Ethereum currently has the largest.  The peer review process takes time with cardano,  but it gives me faith that they are doing things correctly and actually want their vision to become reality.  They don't seem to take short cuts.\n\nThe slow pace meant waiting over two years for nano s integration, but they did deliver. There's been issues with the daedalus wallet they released being slow and buggy.  It had to sync the whole blockchain which took a long time and would get hung up often. The new yoroi wallet is much better.  \n\nI hope that gives you a better idea of what you'll be buying into if you decide to.  Also there's a video I watched before I decided to back this project where Charles does a white board lecture on his vision of cardano.  You should watch it.

It's as if they know something is rotten but just can't bring themselves to be honest. Potentially because the truth would injure their friends, business allies, or source of income? What is this \"truth\" that we don't deserve to know about? Well, here's my stab at an explanation. You'll only need a very small amount of tin foil to make this journey.\n\nBefore you balk at the very idea there could be an actual conspiracy here, let's cover some facts. Fact 1, Polychain Capital is a stakeholder in Parity, Polkadot, and the W3F. Fact 2, Ryan Zurrer was a \"principal and venture partner\" at Polychain Capital before he started working for the W3F. Fact 3, Taylor Monahan/MyCrypto has many deep ties to Polychain, Parity, Polkadot, and the W3F. For instance, Taylor/MyCrypto received $4 million in a series A round from Polychain. MyCrypto and Parity have backed each other's plays on many occasions. Remember when Parity instigated their failed manipulative coin vote over the locked multisig funds? Well, MyCrypto was the only option to interface with that voting contract. There are other examples of suspicious cooperation (or should I call it \"synergy\") between the two, but it'll take time to bring this evidence to the surface.\n\nThe community has at least some grounds to draw reasonable inferences of motive between these facts and the events surrounding Ryan Zurrer and Taylor Monahan's insincere and defensive posturing about his removal here on /r/ethereum. To my way of thinking, it seems highly probable that Taylor is afraid of ousting Ryan because this would sour her ties with Polychain, Parity, Polkadot, and W3F. Let's call them the \"P3W3\", for short. Could it be the P3W3 has been astroturfing the Ethereum community, planting seeds of discontent, running psyops and so on, so that they may finally recover their locked funds? That is, perhaps they've been pursuing covert operations to manufacture a pseudo-consensus among the developers so they could just bypass the community at large? All this would make a lot of sense if Polychain were one of the key affected stakeholders in the multisig snafu. Surely, such possibilities can't just be wished away with magical thinking. They have at least some objectively plausible merit.\n\nOne last remark for you. I posted a thread 14 hours ago, simply [quoting a tweet](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/bcmqtz/virgil_griffith_special_projects_lead_at_the/) by a well-known member of the EF (Virgil Griffith, right hand to Vitalik himself), which was a direct response to a tweet by Ameen about the Ryan Zurrer moderator issue. It seemed well within this forum's norms and guidelines, and yet there's no trace of this thread. I even looked into the [public modlogs](https://moddit.ffff00.news/r/Ethereum) and couldn't find it.

He was exactly right.\n\nThe delisting of BSV is not a victory of the BCH community because it's not a battle we were allowed to fight in.  We tried really fucking hard to fight in it too.  From day one of the split, the BCH community was very publicly calling out the toxic speech and unethical tactics being employed by the two BSV figureheads.  The exchanges didn't give a fraction of a shit what we had to say though. Not even when they threatened to STEAL MONEY from them.\n\nInstead, the battle was fought between two dickhead with big opposing egos.  One of those dickheads just happened to run an exchange.  He finally put his foot down when the other dickhead threatened sue one of his BTC maximilist, lightning shill buddies.  That buddy was as anti-BCH as they come.  This fight had nothing to do with us.\n\nDon't get me wrong.  I'm happy with the outcome here but it came about for all the wrong reasons.  Yes it's great that people are finally pointing at the giant narcissistic elephant in the room.  What's not great is that exchanges have the power to make or break a coin on a whim.  Especially when the largest exchanges are run by people who do not share our ethics or support our cause of sound money for everyone.\n\nNow I'm not saying exchanges shouldn't delist bad actors.  It's their platform.  They should do as they like, period.  The power that they have over coins is just an unintended ( and arguably undesirable ) consequence of us having built the infrastructure in the way that we did.  Decentralized exchanges cannot come soon enough.\n\nWe can celebrate the delisting if that makes us feel nice but don't think for a second our actions caused it or that the exchanges finally listened to us.  They did not.  Also know that those same exchanges have been hard at work looking for data to justify doing to us what they've wanted to do since the day BCH was born: bleed us dry then suffocate us to death.", "yuta  take that shit back", "Self awareness, hell of a precipice.

This includes all cash-back transactions, ACH transfers to another Bank Account, and ALL ATM WITHDRAWLS.\n\n-FirstView Financial, LLC is insisting that BitPay is in fact in control of this- however, as BitPay only serves as a means of exchange, they can only request that this action be taken by the Card Issuers. FirstView Financial has obliged this request.\n\n-BitPay is stating that this is due to a \"Systems Upgrade\" being completed to make transactions smoother. However, after 3 weeks, neither BitPay nor FirstView Financial, LLC is able to give an estimate as to when these \"Systems Upgrades\" will be completed. BitPay has convinced FirstView Financial, LLC to make false statements regarding the true nature behind this move.\n\n-The change was made without warning, and while both FirstView Financial and BitPay insist that users were notified via email, I have personally confirmed the 5/5 users of BitPay, including myself that I personally know, never received such communication.\n\n-FirstView Financial does not have any physical branches, but is in fact an interstate bank. They are legally mandated to allow access to physical currency for their account holders. They are not.\n\n-BitPay in fact hid this information, buried in their FAQ section.\n\n-No warning is given prior to making a deposit to the Visa Debit Card. Customers only become aware of this limitation after attempting to gain access to their cash.\n\n-BitPay will not reverse any transfers made to the cards.\n\n-Neither BitPay nor FirstView Financial is able to provide any details as to why they might be performing a \"systems update,\" stating only that it is for improvement.\n\n-Both companies have shown a readiness to conduct underhanded and deceitful tactics to cover up what is actually transpiring.\n\n*Speculation and Common Sense Reasoning*\n\nAnyone knows that no \"systems update\" takes 3 days, let alone three weeks. Yet after 3 weeks, it appears that there is no plans to bring back cash withdrawals via the ATM card, cash-back pin transactions or ACH transfers. Furthermore, the BitPay system has functioned flawlessly for years. And if there was no reason to lie, than bitpay could have easily displayed messages in their app warning users or prominently on their homepage, or even as an alert when logging into a users account- they did not. It further appears they are telling people that they recieved an email that was never sent.\n\nThe most plausible explanation is that they are under investigation for failing to comply with AML and KYC regulations required by a crypto-fiat exchange. Had their suspension of Cash access been a well planned undertaking, then it could be argued that they simply planned to phase that out to avoid the costs associated with proper identity verification, but their willingness to lie, and convince FirstView Financial to lie suggests that they in fact are working hard to cover up the truth.\n\n**With this in mind, I do not think it is unreasonable to question the conrinued future access to any funds deposited to a prepaid BitPay Visa debit card- even if the user only wishes to spend them at certain merchants with a signature transaction.**\n\n*What to Do*\n\n-Firstly, I suggest anyone with any funds on a BitPay Visa Debit all call FirstView Financial LLC and demand access to their CASH. While FirstView will insist that they are not in control, every person with cash in a BitPay Visa Debit account has an account- unlinked to BitPay in any regard- solely in their own name. No bank is allowed to restrict access to its customers funds (up to $250,000 at a time), saying they can only \"spend\" the money at merchants who accept Visa.\n\n-Demand answers from BitPay! They are being offensive in trying to say they are conducting a systems upgrade.\n\n-Demand BitPay reverse any and all deposits made without this knowledge.\n\n-Make complaints against BitPay and FirstView Financial, LLC to any regulatory body that will take them.\n\n-Finally, this is a legally actionable offense. I am currently seeking an adequate law firm willing to take on a class action suit against both companies- if anyone can help in that endeavour, please comment below.\n\n\u2010-------\n\nLet's not let these two Companies' reckles, careless and fraudulent activities tarnish the reputation of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is the first form of currency that cannot be created indefinitely, as most Fiat currencies are. \n\n2. It is a currency that is not affected by borders (country borders or even digital borders/restrictions). \n\n3. It is a currency which has the potential to be a safe haven for those whose governments are corrupting their Fiat currency by inflation or other forms of mismanagement. \n\n4. It is a currency that is purely digital and governed by consensus, not a single entity.\n\nFor a lot of first world countries, the use-case for Bitcoin doesn't seem apparent; \n\n\"We have services like PayPal, Cash, and Venmo. Why do we need another currency service that uses a weird and pointless currency?\" \n\nWe don't. But the rest of the world does. And we will; if we ever get fed up with our banks putting limits on our transfer rates, spying on every purchase we make, or charging ridiculous credit card fees to businesses, Bitcoin will be there.

In\n2007\u20138, when the global financial system\nimploded, the cry that no one could have\nseen this coming was heard everywhere,\ndespite the existence of numerous analyses\nshowing that a crisis was unavoidable. \n\nThe critical\nissue is the artificial suppression of volatility\u2014the ups and downs of\nlife\u2014in the name of stability. It is both misguided and dangerous to push unobserved\nrisks further into the statistical tails of the\nprobability distribution of outcomes and\nallow these high-impact, low-probability\n\u201ctail risks\u201d to disappear from policymakers\u2019\nfields of observation. \n\nWhat the world is\nwitnessing is simply what happens when highly\nconstrained systems explode.\nComplex systems that have artificially\nsuppressed volatility tend to become\nextremely fragile, while at the same time\nexhibiting no visible risks. In fact, they\ntend to be too calm and exhibit minimal\nvariability as silent risks accumulate\nbeneath the surface.\n\n Although the stated\nintention of political leaders and economic\npolicymakers is to stabilize the system by\ninhibiting fluctuations, the result tends\nto be the opposite. These artificially constrained systems become prone to \u201cBlack\nSwans\u201d\u2014that is, they become extremely\nvulnerable to large-scale events that lie far\nfrom the statistical norm and were largely\nunpredictable to a given set of observers.\nSuch environments eventually experience massive blowups, catching everyone\noff-guard and undoing years of stability\nor, in some cases, ending up far worse than\nthey were in their initial volatile state.\nIndeed, the longer it takes for the blowup\nto occur, the worse the resulting harm in\nboth economic and political systems.\n\n\nSeeking to restrict variability seems to\nbe good policy (who does not prefer stability\nto chaos?), so it is with very good intentions\nthat policymakers unwittingly increase the\nrisk of major blowups. And it is the same\nmisperception of the properties of natural\nsystems that led the economic\ncrisis of 2007\u20138. \n\nThe policy implications\nare: to make systems robust, all\nrisks must be visible and out in the open\u2014\nfluctuat nec mergitur (it fluctuates but does\nnot sink) goes the Latin saying.\nJust as a robust economic system is one\nthat encourages early failures (the concepts\nof \u201cfail small\u201d and \u201cfail fast\u201d), the U.S. government should stop supporting dictatorial regimes for the sake of pseudostability\nand instead allow political noise to rise to\nthe surface. Making an economy robust\nin the face of business swings requires\nallowing risk to be visible; the same is\ntrue in politics.\n\nSEDUCED BY STABILITY\nBoth the recent financial crisis and the political crises in the Middle East\nare grounded in the rise of complexity,\ninterdependence, and unpredictability.\nPolicymakers in the UK and\nthe USA have long promoted\npolicies aimed at eliminating fluctuation\u2014\nno more booms and busts in the economy,\nno more \u201cIranian surprises\u201d in foreign\npolicy. These policies have almost always\nproduced undesirable outcomes.\n\n For\nexample, the U.S. banking system became\nvery fragile following a succession of progressively larger bailouts and government\ninterventions, particularly after the 1983\nrescue of major banks (ironically, by the\nsame Reagan administration that trumpeted free markets). \n\nIn the United States,\npromoting these bad policies has been a\nbipartisan effort throughout. Republicans\nhave been good at fragilizing large corporations through bailouts, and Democrats have\nbeen good at fragilizing the government.\n\n\nAt the same time, the financial system as a\nwhole exhibited little volatility; it kept getting weaker while providing policymakers\nwith the illusion of stability, illustrated\nmost notably when Ben Bernanke, who\nwas then a member of the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve, declared\nthe era of \u201cthe great moderation\u201d in 2004.\n\n\nPutatively independent central\nbankers fell into the same trap. During\nthe 1990s, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair\nAlan Greenspan wanted to iron out the\neconomic cycle\u2019s booms and busts, and he\nsought to control economic swings with\ninterest-rate reductions at the slightest\nsign of a downward tick in the economic\ndata. Furthermore, he adapted his economic policy to guarantee bank rescues,\nwith implicit promises of a backstop\u2014the\nnow infamous \u201cGreenspan put.\u201d \n\nThese\npolicies proved to have grave delayed side\neffects. Washington stabilized the market\nwith bailouts and by allowing certain companies to grow \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d Because\npolicymakers believed it was better to do\nsomething than to do nothing, they felt\nobligated to heal the economy rather than\nwait and see if it healed on its own.\n\n\nThe foreign policy equivalent is to\nsupport the incumbent no matter what.\nAnd just as banks took wild risks thanks to\nGreenspan\u2019s implicit insurance policy, client\ngovernments such as Hosni Mubarak\u2019s in\nEgypt for years engaged in overt plunder\nthanks to similarly reliable U.S. support.\n\n\nThose who seek to prevent volatility on\nthe grounds that any and all bumps in the\nroad must be avoided paradoxically increase\nthe probability that a tail risk will cause a\nmajor explosion.\n\n\nConsider a thought experiment, a man placed in an artificially\nsterilized environment for a decade and\nthen invited to take a ride on a crowded\nsubway; he would be expected to die\nquickly. Likewise, preventing small forest\nfires can cause larger forest fires to become\ndevastating. This property is shared by\nall complex systems.\n\n\nIn the realm of economics, price controls are designed to constrain volatility on\nthe grounds that stable prices are a good\nthing. But although these controls might\nwork in some rare situations, the long-term\neffect of any such system is an eventual\nand extremely costly blowup whose cleanup\ncosts can far exceed the benefits accrued.\n\n\nThe risks of a dictatorship, no matter how\nseemingly stable, are no different, in the\nlong run, from those of an artificially\ncontrolled price.\nSuch attempts to institutionally engineer\nthe world come in two types: those that\nconform to the world as it is and those\nthat attempt to reform the world. The\nnature of humans, quite reasonably, is to intervene in an effort to alter their world and\nthe outcomes it produces. But government\ninterventions are laden with unintended\u2014\nand unforeseen\u2014consequences, particularly\nin complex systems, so humans must work\nwith nature by tolerating systems that\nabsorb human imperfections rather than\nseek to change them.\n\n\nTake, for example, the recent celebrated\ndocumentary on the financial crisis, Inside\nJob, which blames the crisis on the malfeasance and dishonesty of bankers and the\nincompetence of regulators. Although it\nis morally satisfying, the film naively overlooks the fact that humans have always been\ndishonest and regulators have always\nbeen behind the curve. The only difference\nthis time around was the unprecedented\nmagnitude of the hidden risks and a misunderstanding of the statistical properties\nof the system.\n\n\n**What is needed is a system that can\nprevent the harm done to citizens by the\ndishonesty of business elites; the limited\ncompetence of forecasters, economists, and\nstatisticians; and the imperfections of\nregulation, not one that aims to eliminate\nthese flaws.** \n\nHumans must try to resist the\nillusion of control: just as foreign policy\nshould be intelligence-proof (it should\nminimize its reliance on the competence\nof information-gathering organizations\nand the predictions of \u201cexperts\u201d in what\nare inherently unpredictable domains),\nthe economy should be regulator-proof,\ngiven that some regulations simply make\nthe system itself more fragile. Due to the\ncomplexity of markets, intricate regulations\nsimply serve to generate fees for lawyers\nand profits for sophisticated derivatives\ntraders who can build complicated financial\nproducts that skirt those regulations. \n\nDON\u2019T BE A TURKEY\nThe life of a turkey before Thanksgiving\nis illustrative: the turkey is fed for 1,000\ndays and every day seems to confirm that\nthe farmer cares for it\u2014until the last day,\nwhen confidence is maximal. The \u201cturkey\nproblem\u201d occurs when a naive analysis of\nstability is derived from the absence of\npast variations. Likewise, confidence in\nstability was maximal at the onset of the\nfinancial crisis in 2007.\n\n\nThe turkey problem for humans is the\nresult of mistaking one environment for\nanother.\n\n Humans simultaneously inhabit\ntwo systems: the linear and the complex.\n\nThe linear domain is characterized by its\npredictability and the low degree of\ninteraction among its components, which\nallows the use of mathematical methods\nthat make forecasts reliable. \n\nIn complex\nsystems, there is an absence of visible\ncausal links between the elements, masking\na high degree of interdependence and\nextremely low predictability.\n\nNonlinear\nelements are also present, such as those\ncommonly known, and generally misunderstood, as \u201ctipping points.\u201d Imagine\nsomeone who keeps adding sand to a sand\npile without any visible consequence, until\nsuddenly the entire pile crumbles. It would\nbe foolish to blame the collapse on the last\ngrain of sand rather than the structure of the\npile, but that is what people do consistently,\nand that is the policy error.\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama may\nblame an intelligence failure for the government\u2019s not foreseeing the revolution\nin Egypt (just as former U.S. President\nJimmy Carter blamed an intelligence\nfailure for his administration\u2019s not foreseeing the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran),\nbut it is the suppressed risk in the statistical tails that matters\u2014not the failure to\nsee the last grain of sand. As a result of\ncomplicated interdependence and contagion effects, in all man-made complex\nsystems, a small number of possible events\ndominate, namely, Black Swans.\n\n\nEngineering, architecture, astronomy,\nmost of physics, and much of common\nscience are linear domains. The complex\ndomain is the realm of the social world,\nepidemics, and economics. \n\nCrucially, the\nlinear domain delivers mild variations\nwithout large shocks, whereas the complex\ndomain delivers massive jumps and gaps.\nComplex systems are misunderstood,\nmostly because humans\u2019 sophistication,\nobtained over the history of human knowledge in the linear domain, does not transfer\nproperly to the complex domain. \n\nHumans\ncan predict a solar eclipse and the trajectory\nof a space vessel, but not the stock market\nor Egyptian political events. All man-made\ncomplex systems have commonalities and\neven universalities. Sadly, deceptive calm\n(followed by Black Swan surprises) seems\nto be one of those properties.\n\n\nTHE ERROR OF PREDICTION\n\n\nAs with a crumbling sand pile, it would be\nfoolish to attribute the collapse of a fragile\nbridge to the last truck that crossed it, and\neven more foolish to try to predict in\nadvance which truck might bring it down.\n\nThe system is responsible, not the components. But after the financial crisis of\n2007\u20138, many people thought that predicting the subprime meltdown would have\nhelped. It would not have, since it was a\nsymptom of the crisis, not its underlying\ncause. Likewise, Obama\u2019s blaming \u201cbad intelligence\u201d for his administration\u2019s failure to\npredict the crisis in Egypt is symptomatic\nof both the misunderstanding of complex\nsystems and the bad policies involved.\nObama\u2019s mistake illustrates the illusion\nof local causal chains\u2014that is, confusing\ncatalysts for causes and assuming that one\ncan know which catalyst will produce which\neffect. The final episode of the upheaval in\nEgypt was unpredictable for all observers,\nespecially those involved. As such, blaming the cia is as foolish as funding it to\nforecast such events. Governments are\nwasting billions of dollars on attempting\nto predict events that are produced by\ninterdependent systems and are therefore\nnot statistically understandable at the\nindividual level.\n\n\nAs Mark Abdollahian of Sentia Group,\none of the contractors who sell predictive\nanalytics to the U.S. government, noted\nregarding Egypt, policymakers should\n\u201cthink of this like Las Vegas. In blackjack,\nif you can do four percent better than the\naverage, you\u2019re making real money.\u201d But\nthe analogy is spurious. \n\nThere is no \u201cfour\npercent better\u201d on Egypt. This is not just\nmoney wasted but the construction of a\nfalse confidence based on an erroneous\nfocus. It is telling that the intelligence\nanalysts made the same mistake as the\nrisk-management systems that failed to\npredict the economic crisis\u2014and offered\nthe exact same excuses when they failed.\nPolitical and economic \u201ctail events\u201d are\nunpredictable, and their probabilities are\nnot scientifically measurable. \n\nNo matter\nhow many dollars are spent on research,\npredicting revolutions is not the same as\ncounting cards; humans will never be able\nto turn politics into the tractable randomness of blackjack.\nMost explanations being offered for the\ncurrent turmoil in the Middle East follow\nthe \u201ccatalysts as causes\u201d confusion. The\nriots in Tunisia and Egypt were initially\nattributed to rising commodity prices, not\nto stifling and unpopular dictatorships.\nBut Bahrain and Libya are countries with\nhigh gdps that can a\u00aaord to import grain\nand other commodities. Again, the focus is\nwrong even if the logic is comforting. It is\nthe system and its fragility, not events,\nthat must be studied\u2014what physicists call\n\u201cpercolation theory,\u201d in which the properties of the terrain are studied rather than\nthose of a single element of the terrain.\nWhen dealing with a system that is\ninherently unpredictable, what should be\ndone? Differentiating between two types\nof countries is useful. In the first, changes\nin government do not lead to meaningful\ndi\u00aaerences in political outcomes (since\npolitical tensions are out in the open).\nIn the second type, changes in government lead to both drastic and deeply\nunpredictable changes.\nConsider that Italy, with its muchmaligned \u201ccabinet instability,\u201d is economically and politically stable despite having\nhad more than 60 governments since\nWorld War II (indeed, one may say Italy\u2019s\nstability is because of these switches of\ngovernment). \n\nSimilarly, in spite of consistently bad press, Lebanon is a relatively\nsafe bet in terms of how far governments\ncan jump from equilibrium; in spite of\nall the noise, shifting alliances, and street\nprotests, changes in government there\ntend to be comparatively mild. For example, a shift in the ruling coalition from\nChristian parties to Hezbollah is not such\na consequential jump in terms of the\ncountry\u2019s economic and political stability.\n\n\nSwitching equilibrium, with control of\nthe government changing from one party\nto another, in such systems acts as a shock\nabsorber. Since a single party cannot have\ntotal and more than temporary control, the\npossibility of a large jump in the regime\ntype is constrained.\n\n\nIn contrast, consider Iran and Iraq.\nMohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi and Saddam Hussein both constrained volatility\nby any means necessary. In Iran, when\nthe shah was toppled, the shift of power to\nAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was a huge,\nunforeseeable jump. After the fact, analysts\ncould construct convincing accounts about\nhow killing Iranian Communists, driving\nthe left into exile, demobilizing the democratic opposition, and driving all dissent\ninto the mosque had made Khomeini\u2019s\nrise inevitable. \n\nIn Iraq, the United States\nremoved the lid and was actually surprised\nto find that the regime did not jump from\nhyperconstraint to something like France.\nBut this was impossible to predict ahead\nof time due to the nature of the system\nitself. What can be said, however, is that\nthe more constrained the volatility, the\nbigger the regime jump is likely to be. From\nthe French Revolution to the triumph of\nthe Bolsheviks, history is replete with\nsuch examples, and yet somehow humans\nremain unable to process what they mean.\n\n\n\nHumans fear randomness\u2014a healthy\nancestral trait inherited from a different\nenvironment. Whereas in the past, which\nwas a more linear world, this trait enhanced\nfitness and increased chances of survival,\nit can have the reverse effect in today\u2019s\ncomplex world, making volatility take the\nshape of nasty Black Swans hiding behind\ndeceptive periods of \u201cgreat moderation.\u201d\n\n\nThis is not to say that any and all volatility\nshould be embraced. Insurance should\nnot be banned, for example.\n\n\nBut alongside the \u201ccatalysts as causes\u201d\nconfusion sit two mental biases: the illusion\nof control and the action bias (the illusion\nthat doing something is always better than\ndoing nothing). This leads to the desire to\nimpose man-made solutions. Greenspan\u2019s\nactions were harmful, but it would have\nbeen hard to justify inaction in a democracy\nwhere the incentive is to always promise a\nbetter outcome than the other guy, regardless of the actual, delayed cost.\n\n\nVariation is information. When there\nis no variation, there is no information.\nThis explains the cia\u2019s failure to predict\nthe Egyptian revolution and, a generation\nbefore, the Iranian Revolution\u2014in both\ncases, the revolutionaries themselves did\nnot have a clear idea of their relative\nstrength with respect to the regime they\nwere hoping to topple. \n\nSo rather than subsidize and praise as a \u201cforce for stability\u201d\nevery tin-pot potentate on the planet,\nthe U.S. government should encourage\ncountries to let information flow upward\nthrough the transparency that comes with\npolitical agitation. It should not fear fluctuations per se, since allowing them to be\nin the open, as Italy and Lebanon both\nshow in different ways, creates the stability\nof small jumps.\n\n\nAs Seneca wrote in De clementia,\n\u201cRepeated punishment, while it crushes\nthe hatred of a few, stirs the hatred of\nall . . . just as trees that have been trimmed\nthrow out again countless branches.\u201d The\nimposition of peace through repeated\npunishment lies at the heart of many\nseemingly intractable conflicts, including\nthe Israeli-Palestinian stalemate. \n\nFurthermore, dealing with seemingly reliable\nhigh-level offcials rather than the people\nthemselves prevents any peace treaty signed\nfrom being robust. The Romans were wise\nenough to know that only a free man under\nRoman law could be trusted to engage in a\ncontract; by extension, only a free people\ncan be trusted to abide by a treaty.\n\n Treaties\nthat are negotiated with the consent of a\nbroad swath of the populations on both\nsides of a conflict tend to survive. \n\nJust as no\ncentral bank is powerful enough to dictate\nstability, no superpower can be powerful\nenough to guarantee solid peace alone.\n\n\nU.S. policy toward the Middle East has\nhistorically, and especially since 9/11, been\nunduly focused on the repression of any\nand all political fluctuations in the name\nof preventing \u201cIslamic fundamentalism\u201d\u2014\na trope that Mubarak repeated until his\nlast moments in power and that Libyan\nleader Muammar al-Qaddafi continues\nto emphasize today, blaming Osama\nbin Laden for what has befallen him. This\nis wrong. The West and its autocratic Arab\nallies have strengthened Islamic fundamentalists by forcing them underground,\nand even more so by killing them.\n\n\nAs Jean-Jacques Rousseau put it, \u201cA\nlittle bit of agitation gives motivation to\nthe soul, and what really makes the species\nprosper is not peace so much as freedom.\u201d\nWith freedom comes some unpredictable\nfluctuation. This is one of life\u2019s packages:\nthere is no freedom without noise\u2014and\nno stability without volatility", "RT @Surfermom77: Democrats are the most hateful people,\n#DemocratsAreDangerous \nNadler subpoenaed a dead man, Peter Smith, GOP activist who", "@kawwwoin Get rid of that founders reward of 5%....  shit is getting serious... you guys have time to reconsider... https://t.co/RTaDgbLxeq", "@Greg74124049 @GenesisMining It's a ripoff and the only one getting richer is Marco Streng.

Serious research has been done on the subject to say the exact same thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause of the *know-it-all* attitude I run into with many computer scientist, which I hate\ud83d\ude01. I take extra caution to make sure I don't do the same. I come to say why *prediction markets wont work* after doing a massive amount of thinking with evidence to back it up. Perhaps it'll be analogical to ripping the band-aid off. Modifying expectations for investors, and forcing the producers of such a market to make solid game theoretical modifications to such markets to provide massive value over time. I'm not saying they won't work 100%, they'll slightly work. I am saying they won't be as high impact as we think they will be. For them to reach high impact, they need to make a lot of little changes to reach major objectives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll be referring to Duncan Watt's book, ***Everything Is Obvious: \\*Once You Know the Answer***. He's a physicist turned sociologist, turned computer scientist. His book got me deeply into systems theory and complexity in relation to the socio-economic realm years ago. So much that I'm now focusing and staking my entire career on it, even though so far the socio-econo-physics, complexity and analytics industry hasn't yielded any productive results for the world since its inception (besides a compromise of privacy to sell things). We still haven't solved market crashes, inequality, wars between countries, global warming and massive global debt. We've provided little value so far. My goal is to at some point change that over time; to prove our worth as an industry and provide value to people using the blockchain as a medium.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe book is an easy read, and has references to why prediction markets wont work. Inside of the book he talks about common sense, and how it fails us for large scale problems. We're going to only focus on the prediction side in this piece. If I get a reasonable response for this (not necessarily a good one), I'll write more about complexity economics, social complexity and systems theory.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Reasons Why Prediction Markets Won't Work\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. Predicting Large Complex Systems Is Extremely Difficult**\n\nIn chapter 7, between pages 161 and 171, Duncan Watts talks heavily about us making predictions on complex adaptive systems. Generally, the more complex and large the systems are, the more difficult it is to predict the events that follow. This is especially the case when you, and all others have a massive degree of information asymmetry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuncan Watts stated the following about complex systems:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*In complex systems, however, which comprise most of our social and economic life, the best we can hope for is to reliably estimate the probabilities with which certain kinds of events will occur. Second, common sense also demands that we ignore the many uninteresting, unimportant predictions that we could be making all the time, and focus on those outcomes that actually matter. In reality ... black swan events that we most wish we could have predicted are not really events at all, but rather shorthand descriptions\u2014\u201cthe French Revolution,\u201d \u201cthe Internet,\u201d \u201cHurricane Katrina,\u201d \u201cthe global financial crisis\u201d\u2014of what are in reality whole swaths of history. Predicting black swans is therefore doubly hopeless, because until history has played out it\u2019s impossible even to know what the relevant terms are.*\n\nHe doesn't mean that everything in existence is unpredictable. He does say later that there's a fine line between predictable elements and unpredictable ones. He followed with a statement:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>To oversimplify somewhat, there are two kinds of events that arise in complex social systems\u2014***events that conform to some stable historical pattern, and events that do not*** ... Every year, for example, each of us may or may not be unlucky enough to catch the flu ... because seasonal influenza trends are relatively consistent from year to year, drug companies can do a reasonable job of anticipating how many flu shots they will need to ship to a given part of the world in a given month ... consumers with identical financial backgrounds may vary widely in their likelihood of *defaulting on a credit card, depending on what is going on in their lives ... credit card companies can do a surprisingly good job of predicting aggregate default rates by paying attention to a range of socioeconomic, demographic, and behavioral variables*. And *Internet* ***companies are increasingly taking advantage of the mountains of Web-browsing data generated by their users to predict the probability that a given user will click on a given search result***.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrediction markets don't distinguish what's reasonably predictable or what's not. The larger and more abstract the event, the more likely it is we won't be able to interpret a solid prediction of what's real or not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. Prediction Markets Provide Little Gain Compared to Statistical Studies**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe prospect of prediction markets are very nice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInside of that same chapter, Watts put some focus on prediction markets. Starting with the introduction of the idea.\n\n>One increasingly popular method is to use what is called a prediction market\u2014meaning a market in which buyers and sellers can trade specially designed securities whose prices correspond to the predicted probability that a specific outcome will take place. - p 164\n\n&#x200B;\n\nContinuing with understanding why our sentiment of prediction markets is so high. I too get excited about the idea of them, and he stated the potential scenarios of how they would interact:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The potential of prediction markets to tap into collective wisdom has generated a tremendous amount of excitement among professional economists and policy makers alike. Imagine, for example, that a market had been set up to predict the possibility of a catastrophic failure in deep-water oil drilling in the Gulf prior to the BP disaster in April 2010. Possibly insiders like BP engineers could have participated in the market, effectively making public what they knew about the risks their firms were taking. Possibly then regulators would have had a more accurate assessment of those risks and been more inclined to crack down on the oil industry before a disaster took place. Possibly the disaster could have been averted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, he and many others have done studies in prediction markets to test if this can accurately happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWatts tested for the accuracy of markets compared to statistical mechanics:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*little attention has been paid to evaluating the relative performance of different methods, so nobody really knows for sure. To try to settle the matter, my colleagues at Yahoo! Research and I conducted a systematic comparison of several different prediction methods, where the predictions in question were the outcomes of NFL football games. To begin with, for each of the fourteen to sixteen games taking place each weekend over the course of the 2008 season, we conducted a poll in which we asked respondents to state the probability that the home team would win as well as their confidence in their prediction. We also collected similar data from the website Probability Sports, an online contest where participants can win cash prizes by predicting the outcomes of sporting events. Next, we compared the performance of these two polls with the Vegas sports betting market\u2014one of the oldest and most popular betting markets in the world\u2014as well as with another prediction market, TradeSports. And finally, we compared the prediction of both the markets and the polls against two simple statistical probability that home teams win\u2014which they do 58 percent of the time\u2014while the second model also factored in the recent win-loss records of the two teams in question. In this way, we set up a six-way comparison between different prediction methods\u2014two statistical models, two markets, and two polls.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***The results:***\n\n>*Given how different these methods were, what we found was surprising:* ***All of them performed about the same.*** *To be fair,* ***the two prediction markets performed a little better than the other methods***\\*, which is consistent with the theoretical argument above. But the very best performing method\u2014the Las Vegas Market\u2014**was only about 3 percentage points more accurate than the worst-performing method**, which was the model that always predicted the home team would win with 58 percent probability.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe's a reasonable scientist. When he crafted a result, he tested it to see if he was wrong using other data-sets. We generally call it ***falsification***. It's the process of testing a hypothesis for inaccuracies. Doing this in the social realm is very hard, yet also requires the same amount of rigor. He followed it with another set of studies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first talked to the prediction market researchers:\n\n>*When we first told some prediction market researchers about this result, their reaction was that it must reflect some special feature of football ... Football games, in other words, have a lot of randomness built into them\u2014arguably, in fact, that\u2019s what makes them exciting. In order to be persuaded, our colleagues insisted, we would have to find the same result in some other domain for which the signal-to-noise ratio might be considerably higher than it is in the specific case of football.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo they tested for baseball. This was their results for that.\n\n>*We compared the predictions of the Las Vegas sports betting markets over nearly twenty thousand Major League baseball games played from 1999 to 2006 with a simple statistical model based again on home-team advantage and the recent win-loss records of the two teams. This time,* ***the difference between the two was even smaller\u2014in fact, the performance of the market and the model were indistinguishable****. In spite of all the statistics and analysis, in other words, and in spite of the absence of meaningful salary caps in baseball and the resulting concentration of superstar players on teams like the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox, the outcomes of baseball games are even closer to random events than football games. - p170*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. Some People Want to See The World Burn**\n\nThis is the final reason. \n\nIn the Dark Knight, Alfred had a power speech directly to Bruce Wayne. He made the statement *\"some people just want to watch the world burn\".*  This is a problem generally faced with every game theoretical problem. It faces characters like the Joker in the Batman, Hisoka in Hunter X Hunter. The characters that just destroy for the fun of it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuncan Watts actually explored the concept. He states the following: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*... it exposed a potential vulnerability of the theory, which assumes that rational traders will not deliberately lose money. The problem is that if the goal of a participant is instead to manipulate perceptions of people outside the market (like the media) and if the amounts involved are relatively small (tens of thousands of dollars, say, compared with the tens of millions of dollars spent on TV advertising), then they may not care about losing money, in which case it\u2019s no longer clear what signal the market is sending.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrediction markets forget about the idea of reflexivity, and the desire just to destroy stuff. Ultimately there's no protections against this. Even if they were to find enough active participants, you would have to worry about somebody with $1-2 million dollars just to influence somebody's perceptions on small, yet significant ideas, it could wreck havoc on people using such markets to plan. Especially if those plans are leveraged. It's a problem of opportunity cost. Generally, if I earn more for destroying your system from another, even if I earn indirectly, I'll just do it because why not?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's essentially the same problem behind market manipulation. People would be fine destroying the market if they get some indirect benefit from it. George Soros did it when he broke the Bank of England, some unknown figures did it when they tanked the market below $6000. It's easy. There's no defense mechanism against it in international markets, where anybody with a computer can tap in and blow things up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI recall seeing a recent article by somebody on this subreddit. He was putting together a solution to reduce the uncooperative games people may want to play and convert them into cooperative games using staking as a means to limit options. It works to an extent, but it runs the problem of destructive tendencies and opportunity cost. It also requires identity, which I doubt people will subscribe to if they don't have to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**That's it**\n\nSo that concludes why I reason prediction markets wont work. It's mostly an analysis. I infer, that just because you can't use them in one way, doesn't mean you can use them in others. I would say that it's unreasonable to believe that's the case. The predictions are just too big in range and not heavily well defined.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, if I get feedback to this I'll post on other topics like . \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sources and Bits of Information:**\n\n1. Ian Ayres (author of Supercrunchers ) calls the relative performance of prediction markets \u201cone of the great unresolved questions of predictive analytics\u201d ( [http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/23/prediction-markets-vs-super-crunching-which-can-better-predict-how-justice-kennedy-will-vote/](http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/23/prediction-markets-vs-super-crunching-which-can-better-predict-how-justice-kennedy-will-vote/) ). \n2. To be precise, we had different amounts of data for each of the methods\u2014for example, our own polls were conducted over only the 2008\u20132009 season, whereas we had nearly thirty years of Vegas data, and TradeSports predictions ended in November 2008, when it was shut down\u2014so we couldn\u2019t compare all six methods over any given time interval. Nevertheless, for any given interval, we were always able to compare multiple methods. See Goel, Reeves, et al.

It is well known that almost all fruit trees bear fruit only for about two months, and they can no longer bear fruit for the remaining ten months of the year. Exactly the same story with the economy. For example, take a grape tree as a sample. Within two months you collect grapes. You sell one serving fresh, from the other you produce juice, raisins, vinegar and wine to sell them within ten months before the next harvest. But this natural formula, fruit tree, economy and everything else cannot work perfectly all the time. Because it depends on us, society and nature. Thus, basically we can expose two types of economy.\n\nThe first economy is natural or physical. When agriculture, trade and industry depend on bad and good relationships with yourself, that is, it means to what extent we are fair or truthful and favorable conditions of nature in which we all live. In this type of economy, the valuation of goods takes place in accordance with actual circumstances, which we cannot control. The second economy is artificial and virtual. This type of economy sooner or later arises from the natural economy, when people start to get excessive profits. To save these excessive incomes, people start looking for ways to save and multiply profits. In this case, the pricing process for goods becomes an attempt by people to impose their will on society and nature. Basically, banks, stock markets and government bonds are used for this purpose. The comedy and utopia of artificial economy is an attempt to subordinate nature to human will. This has never happened in the history of mankind. Man may be deceived, but there is no chance of deceiving nature, even the slightest chance. The first, that is the natural economy, basically depends on rains. The second type, that is, artificial economy, depends on how long people want to deceive each other. Such an economy cannot last long and has a very short period of existence, as historically known. This is because it has nothing to do with nature or with the true reality in us and the nature around us. Historically, a person can successfully deceive another person, but nature cannot.\n\nAll the scriptures claim that usury or money given and taken on interest loans is a sin. Why? Because there is no such thing as an increase in interest rates on loans in nature or, in other words, in the physical and spiritual world.\n\nFor example, a person invested his money in a bank in order to receive interest, for example, 10% per annum as profit. Let's take as a sample $ 100,000. His 100,000 will theoretically rise to 110,000 a year with a 10% interest rate. Suppose that if this person invested his money in a bank in 2016, then in 2019 his money should grow to 130,000 dollars. But he decided to take all his money this year, that is 130,000 due to fear of a financial crisis. But the bank has no such amount. If in the country where he lives, 10% of inflation is observed annually, this means that his 100,000 dollars annually lose their value by 10%, which, in turn, means that his money lost its value by 30% within three years. That is, in fact, his amount in the bank is 70.000. This is not the end. As I said above, interest rate increases do not exist. It may not be possible to believe, but it is true. If this person received 10% of the annual income from their money, you can ask where the bank gets the money to pay this 10% annual profit, that is, 10,000 US dollars. The answer is pretty simple. His entire annual payment of 10%, that is, $ 10,000, is made at the expense of his own money. That is, in three years he received 30,000 dollars, or, in other words, he was paid with his own money, that is, this means that we must cut an additional 30,000 of his 70,000 dollars. And ultimately, there is only $ 40,000 in his bank account. Even this amount cannot be returned to him due to the fact that the remaining $ 40,000 was spent by the bank or given to someone as a loan. And it is unlikely that these borrowed money will ever return.\ufeff", "@MoonOverlord Bullshit", "@Nico_VanderB La France mets du temps  abandonner tout ce bullshit Blockchain ... \n\nAux US a fait quelques mois https://t.co/Bk56J5ZbbQ", "Horrible deal on duct tape and flour.

My wife bitches about me wearing them because they \u201clook so trashy\u201d.", "# Purpose\n\nThe primary purpose of this document is to provide transparency into the role of /r/ethereum moderators and define what is expected of those moderators. As a side effect, this document provides guidance when evaluating the addition of a new moderator or the re-evaluation of an existing moderator.\n\nThis document also covers the role of /r/ethereum as a public forum, as well as the roles, responsibilities, and expectations of /r/ethereum participants.\n\n# Perception & Expectations of Moderators\n\nRegardless of how moderators view themselves, many people who visit or contribute to /r/ethereum view being a moderator as a privilege, not a right, burden, nor chore. Many see the moderators as being in a trusted position which lends credibility to their statements and gives them influence. Thus, many expect moderators to reflect and represent this community, the larger Ethereum ecosystem, and the values of Ethereum. Furthermore, many expect the moderators to be dedicated to Ethereum, and to keep Ethereum\u2019s long-term growth and goals top-of-mind.\n\nModerators should be mindful that their public words have the ability and power to shape, control, and influence the discussions. Their statements have the potential to be extremely valuable and impactful.\n\nFor these reasons, moderators should be mindful about how their commentary *could be perceived* by the diverse set of people who make up the Ethereum community. While moderating, participating in discussions on /r/ethereum, and even while participating in external discussion (e.g. on Twitter, on other forums, at conferences, etc.), they should aim to be transparent, communicate clearly, be explicit about their intentions, provide necessary context, and act in good faith.\n\nWhile some existing moderators or potential moderators may see this as unnecessarily limiting or burdensome, they should understand that many in the community strongly desire and encourage moderators to be active in discussions, to engage with the community, to share their viewpoints, to participate in open debate, to promote and help shape the goals and culture of the subreddit, and, most of all, to lead by example. Being mindful does not mean one must censor themselves or avoid disagreements. It simply means that one should ensure the tone and content of their commentary is ultimately constructive, not destructive.\n\nIf, after reading the above, a moderator cannot agree to be responsible and mindful in both their /r/ethereum participation and external discussion, they should be willing to excuse themselves from that role.\n\n# Expectations of Participants\n\nIn turn, participants on /r/ethereum and people around the Ethereum ecosystem should be mindful that no one is perfect, not even /r/ethereum moderators \ud83d\ude09. Living up to the aforementioned expectations is no small undertaking. While moderators try to do their best to meet the defined expectations, contributors are asked to practice patience and civility if and when they feel a moderator is not upholding their duties to the best of their ability.\n\nAs a first approach, people are encouraged to assume good-faith and respectfully open a dialog with the moderator, preferably in a public reply to the post or comment that is particularly concerning. A good way to start this dialog is by asking for clarification to ensure the participant clearly understands what the moderator *meant*. This ensures both parties are on the same page and provides an opportunity for clarification.\n\nIf the dialog is not fruitful and a person still strongly believes a moderator is not upholding their duties. Please avoid personal insults, brigading, ad hominems, inciting a mob-like mentality, overly emotional commentary, or sharing private conversations or information without the other party\u2019s consent. By being objective and setting a tone that encourages open-minded discussion, the conversation can be productive rather than polarizing, and, thus, is more likely to lead to a positive result for the community as a whole. If there is clear identification of a breach of mod roles and responsibilities, we would invite a message to the mod group to evaluate the situation and moderator in question. If there is no response on the matter from the moderators within 10 days, than a post on the topic would be appropriate.\n\nThe action that is taken after this discussion, if any, is reliant on the amount and type of input from the community and fellow moderators and handled on a case-by-case basis. This ensures each case is approached in proper context and not prior to the presently-unknown future circumstances. Ideally, if there is a large calling for a moderator to be removed, the moderator in question will voluntarily step down. Doing so should not be interpreted as the moderator agreeing with or admitting fault to the claims presented, but simply that the moderator is willing to sacrifice their position in order to avoid further conflict and distraction.\n\nAdditional details can be found in the \u201cEvaluating a Moderator\u201d section below. Lastly, please limit discussions to a single thread so the commentary can be more easily followed.\n\n# Role of /r/ethereum in the ecosystem\n\nThis subreddit is a trusted source of information, news, announcements, and discussions regarding (almost) everything Ethereum. It is often the go-to place for the latest information and a place newcomers arrive at looking for information and help as they get started. Posts and discussions and answers to questions often show up at the top of search results. It is also currently the most widely-used forum dedicated to longer-form discussion regarding Ethereum, though some argue it is not necessarily \u201cthe best\u201d forum.\n\nSome people who were previously active participants on /r/ethereum that are no longer active participants have cited lower quality content, lower quality discussions, unproductive arguments, trollish behavior, or personal attacks as the reason for becoming inactive. Regardless of the truthfulness of those reasons, they are the feelings and perceptions of some of those who left and should not be invalidated.\n\nFurthermore, many people cite the inclusiveness and welcoming nature of the community as their reason for focusing their time and efforts on Ethereum. Some note how turned off by the maximalism they experienced in other online communities, and didn\u2019t dive deeply into the blockchain space until they found Ethereum.\n\nFor the above reasons it is vital that this community is preserved in order to onboard the next generation of Ethereum builders and contributors *and* keep the existing builders and contributors. This subreddit and the larger community should encourage newcomers and existing members alike to participate.\n\nThis **does not** mean that everyone should always be in agreement. Diversity of ideas is more valuable than agreement. As Ethereum grows, the attitudes, goals, and views of community members become more diverse. This is a positive, even with the accompanying growing pains. Debate, competition, and disagreements are necessary to push things forward and evolve. It is incredibly valuable, so long as the disagreements do not devolve and have a negative effect on the ecosystem.\n\n## /r/ethereum aims to be a place...\n\n* ...for the open and good-faith discussion about the Ethereum blockchain, decentralized applications, governance, and related technologies.\n* ...that is not in perfect agreement all the time.\n* ...that values transparency, respect, decentralization, inclusivity, diversity.\n* ...made up of unique people with different backgrounds and worldviews.\n* ...filled with healthy, critical thinking.\n* ...to help advance the goals of Ethereum.\n* ...that consistently practices respect and empathy.\n* ...that is inclusive and encouraging of all types of people with all types of experiences.\n* ...that is welcoming, helpful, and patient with newcomers.\n* ...that aids in increasing the adoption of Ethereum.\n* ...to engage in civil discourse, controversial debates, and open discussions about problems.\n* ...void of hate, vitriol, insults, slurs, threats of violence, witch hunts. ...that encourages healthy debate and critical discussions surrounding Ethereum.\n\nEach day, we should strive to create and grow a welcoming, collaborative, productive environment that contributes and grows Ethereum as a whole\u2014one that helps progress Ethereum as a technology, as a set of loosely-shared values, a better version of the web, and as a community.\n\n# Roles & Responsibilities of Moderators\n\nFirst and foremost, the role of the moderators is to serve the Ethereum community. They should act in good faith and with Ethereum\u2019s best interest at heart as they make decisions and participate in discussions.\n\nIdeally, a moderator\u2019s decisions should be objective: remove posts that clearly violate the subreddit\u2019s listed rules and approve posts that do not violate the subreddits listed rules. Realistically, posts and rules require some amount of subjectivity.\n\nModerators should be thoughtful regarding the subjective decisions they make and strive for fairness, honesty, and transparency with themselves, their fellow moderators, and with the entire community.\n\nWhen removing a post or comment that is not obviously spam or a scam, the moderator should leave a note citing the rule that was violated. When removing posts, especially those with discussion, moderators should additionally \u2018distinguish & sticky\u2019 their comment. In most cases, a reply of, \u201cWe have removed your post for violating rule #2: Price discussion. Please keep price discussion to subreddits such as /r/ethtrader.\u201d is sufficient. For removals that may be controversial, more insight should be provided.\n\n## On a day-to-day basis, a moderators tasks include...\n\n* Approving posts that were incorrectly removed by the automoderator.\n* Removing posts that break the subreddit\u2019s stated rules.\n* Bringing any posts that require subjective decision-making or fall into a \u201cgray area\u201d in the rules to the attention of the moderation team for discussion.\n* Participating in discussions, especially those regarding moderation (both public posts on /r/ethereum or discussions in the internal moderator chat).\n* When necessary, starting and leading discussions regarding updating or adjusting the subreddit rules.\n* When necessary, attempting to improve the efficiency and success-rate of the automoderator. The automoderator is a very fickle beast.\n\n## Moderators should...\n\n* ...ensure discussions stay on-topic, civil, and productive.\n* ...lead by example.\n* ...be an active participant in the subreddit by promoting civil discourse, asking thoughtful questions, and encouraging people and projects.\n* ...be calm and polite, even when other participants are not.\n* ...offer helpful rule explanations, tips, and links to new or confused users.\n* ...keep a unified front when addressing users officially.\n* ...be open to the viewpoints of other moderators and participants and try to reach consensus on difficult items.\n\n## Moderators should not...\n\n* ...moderate posts based on personal ideologies.\n* ...distinguish comments or submissions when not speaking officially on behalf of /r/ethereum.\n* ...act unilaterally when making major revisions to rules, sidebars, or stylesheets.\n* ...take moderation positions in communities where their profession, employment, or biases could pose a direct conflict of interest to the neutral and user driven nature of reddit.\n* ...encourage or \"feed\" trolls.\n* ...ban users when they have not broken any rules.\n\n## Moderators should never...\n\nModerators should never moderate posts in which the moderator has a clear conflict of interest. This includes, but is not limited to, posts regarding: the moderator in question, the moderator\u2019s own company/product/project, or companies/products/projects in which the moderator is heavily emotionally or financially invested in.\n\n## Moderators should take extra care when...\n\nModerators should take extra care when moderating posts in which the moderator has a potential conflict of interest, and consider bringing the post to the attention of fellow moderators rather than moderating it themselves. This includes, but is not limited to, posts regarding a potential or perceived conflict of interest, posts by a contributor the moderator has had negative interactions with in the past, posts regarding a competitor to the moderator\u2019s company/product/project.\n\n## Moderators are not expected to\u2026.\n\nWhile moderators should endeavour to comply with the above roles and responsibilities, there are some items that are not expected of moderators.\n\n* Moderators do not need to be working full-time for Ethereum or Ethereum-related projects. Moderators are encouraged to have a life outside of /r/ethereum.\n* Moderators are not expected to disclose their financial investments or general financial state with anyone. Furthermore, moderators can invest in the assets they choose and even support non-Ethereum projects, provided the moderator does not act nor moderate against Ethereum or it\u2019s long-term interests.\n* Moderators do not need to hold viewpoints that are widely accepted by the community. Moderators may themselves promote civil debate on controversial items or hold contradictory ideas, so long as those are expressed within the rules of the /r/ethereum subreddit and are not clearly against Ethereum\u2019s long-term interests.\n* Moderators are not expected to produce a certain number of posts or comments. Moderators should be performing their duties and engaging with the community with at least a weekly cadence.\n\n## Evaluating a Mod\n\nIn response to the feedback received from members of the community and the reasons outlined in the \u201cPerception & Expectations of Moderators\u201d section above, the following items attempt to provide some guidelines for evaluating a moderator or calling for the removal of a moderator.\n\nEach case will be unique and this is not a comprehensive list. For example, a moderator may provide value in other ways not included in this list and that value should not be discredited or ignored when evaluating.\n\n* Do they support the Ethereum community?\n* Do they act in good faith and with Ethereum\u2019s best interests at heart?\n* Do they aim to ensure discussions stay on-topic, civil, productive?\n* Do they lead by example? (Some examples could include: promoting civil discourse, engaging in discussion, asking thoughtful questions, encouraging people and projects.)\n* Have they ever moderated a post in which there is a potential or perceived conflict of interest without first consulting other mods?\n* Have they ever moderated something based on personal ideologies?\n* Do they approve posts incorrectly removed by the automoderator?\n* Do they remove posts that break the subreddit rules?\n* Do they participate in discussions with other mods or the community? How often do they perform the aforementioned moderator duties? Daily? Weekly? Not for some time?\n* Have they ever started a discussion on the subreddit rules? Should they have?\n* Have they ever attempted to tame the wild beast that is the automoderator? Do they have the skills to do that? Should they have?\n* Are they transparent about their reasons for removing a post when asked?\n* Have they ever moderated posts in which they have a clear conflict of interest? Is their primary focus on Ethereum, or something else? (Day job, traditional world, banks, other blockchains, etc.) Does this have a real effect on their role in Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem or their responsibilities as a moderator of /r/ethereum?\n\n# Roles & Responsibilities of Participants\n\nEach person who contributes to /r/ethereum should aim to add value to the discussion and to the larger Ethereum community, in good faith, and as described above under \u201cRole of /r/ethereum in the ecosystem\u201d.\n\nEach person is responsible for what /r/ethereum is today and what it becomes tomorrow. Some tangible \u201cdo\u2019s\u201d and \u201cdo not\u2019s\u201d for participants are outlined below. However, the scope of these is quite limited compared to what is described in the \u201cRole of /r/ethereum in the ecosystem\u201d section above. Therefore, it is the responsibility of each participant to take their own life experiences, perceptions, skills, knowledge, opinions, and understanding to add value to /r/ethereum to the best of their ability.\n\n## Making the Best of /r/ethereum\n\n**Aim for positivity.** Discuss in good-faith and assume others are discussing in good-faith as well. Be welcoming, inclusive, and encouraging. Practice patience, respect, and empathy. Engage in healthy debate, civil discourse, and critical discussions. Focus on the post, not the poster, during disagreements.\n\n**Upvote and downvote things.** This built-in moderation tool is exceptionally powerful. Keep in mind, upvotes/downvotes are not for voicing agreement/disagreement. When a post or comment contributes or adds value, even if one personally disagrees, it should be upvoted. When a post or comment does not contribute, nor add value, or the post or comment is off-topic, downvote it.\n\n**Use the report button.** Posts or comments that violate the subreddit rules can, and should, be reported. This brings it to the moderator\u2019s attention more quickly. When reporting, please provide as much detail as possible to help moderators more quickly evaluate each item in the moderation queue. Lastly, please don\u2019t report posts or comments out of disagreement, only about things that actually break the rules.\n\n**Stay on topic.** Discussions about other cryptocurrencies and related technologies are welcome, but if the topic is already being extensively covered by other threads, it is kindly recommended to post it to a more specific subreddit. There is an extensive (but not comprehensive) list of Ethereum-related Subreddits on the [\"All Ethereum\" Multireddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/all_ethereum/m/all_ethereum/).\n\n## Follow the Subreddit Rules\n\n**No inappropriate behavior.** This includes, but is not limited to: personal insults, threats of violence, slurs of any kind, posting people's private information.\n\n**Avoid speculation, price, market, and mining discussions.** Discussion related to the price of ether, buying, trading, market speculation, or any other price/market talk should be posted on /r/ethtrader, a third-party Subreddit not moderated by us. In addition, keep mining discussion to subreddits such as /r/EtherMining.\n\n**No spamming, scamming, drive-by posting, duplicate posts, misleading titles, or blogspam.**\n\n* Don\u2019t spam a single blog, project, company, or ICO. Posts should come from a variety of sources, cover different topics, and the poster should engage in discussions on their posts.\n* Don\u2019t attempt to scam people, link to phishing websites, or promote malicious applications.\n* Don\u2019t be that person who runs into the community, dumps a link to something, and then disappears immediately.\n* Check [https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/new/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/new/) to avoid posting something that is already being discussed. Instead, add to the ongoing conversation.\n* Avoid titles that do not accurately reflect the content of the post or are written to stimulate clicks.\n* Avoid linking to sites that lightly rewrite content in order to drive traffic to their site and generate ad revenue.\n\n**No using multiple accounts. No posting from brand new accounts.** Creating multiple accounts to get around rules is not allowed and will likely result in a permanent ban. Additionally, posts should be made from accounts at least 10 days old with a minimum of 20 comment karma. This is to keep trolls and spam-bots to a minimum. Exceptions may be made on a discretionary basis and one can [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/ethereum) if one feels their post adds value but they don\u2019t have the necessary account age/karma.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWe invite feedback from the community on the above guideline and encourage discussion on the topics herein. r/ethereum is a place for discussing Ethereum as a technology and a movement. Our focus is on maintaining the discourse in a productive and respectful direction.\n\nAll the best,\n\nr/ethereum mods", " r/Bitcoin\n\nWithin my next lines of text I might sound like a greedy moon boy. I honestly gotta say FUCK YOU!  I have never been a great speaker, nor I convinced anyone with my talks. I tried the political and unemotional way to emphasize what I want to tell the world. But hey, this shit did not work at all. I tried to make our future brighter and hoped to change the it at least a bit for a better. r/CryptoCurrency showed me that all of them are a bunch of little bitches. Yea my words might be cringe but this is who I am! I spent a lot of time to become what I adored and what I believed in during the last few months. All you guys care is about some chicks selling Bitcoin stickers on the internet and hope to see a nipple.  Honestly!! Do you guys even  want adoption?  I proudly can say that I lost all my friends, my family and even girlfriend... Because I have been working on a thing that is so much bigger than the world I am living in. It has been a rough time for me and I fucking wont let this be unseen. If this sub rejects me again, I will stand up again!\n\nDear r/Bitcoin this is what I posted:\n\n \n\nI've been working on a new hybrid payment processing system on the lightning network with full wallet control.\n\nI  believe that cryptocurrencies can actually replace fiat money and  support a healthier economy not led by central banks and the government.  Don't get me wrong I don't want to cut them out or threaten them. But  so much could be better without them. So please buckle on your seatbelt  and listen closely.\n\nThe main properties:\n\n* You receive the private keys after signing up. They will only be stored locally on your phone.\n* You can import/delete your existing wallet with your mnemonic cipher seed.\n* It has a big focus on privacy.\n* Lightning transactions are used\n* Minimum transaction fees.\n\nFirst of all this is not an ad, I am asking for your help. My applications uses 3 main components:\n\n**The API**\n\nThe  API consists out of several nodes connected to the blockchain to handle  all requests of the users. It covers all endpoints of the [Lightning network daemon](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd)  which allows the user to receive a lot of information about the wallet  and the nodes itself. At this point I want to thank the LND guys for  their awesome work and pure dedication. You opened a whole world of  possibilities for the crypto community!\n\n**The module**\n\nThe  module is currently a raspberry Pi with a touch screen attached to it.  It runs a node server to display a QR code the user can scan and  transmit a fraction of the transaction block to the API to secure the  application. A transaction block is similar to a lightning payment  request. It provides additional information for retailers to do their  book keeping. The module also shows the final result of the payment.\n\n**The module client**\n\nThe  module client is a native mobile application that is mostly acting as a  validation and transmission layer between the module and the API.  Additionally private and confidential information such as private keys  are stored onto a local database and will never be sent back to the API.\n\nThere  are lots of future plans for the payment processor to even get rid of  the API, however I do certainly fear that the vast majority is not yet  ready to take responsibility for their own wallet security.\n\nMost  custody wallets collect all your data, sell them and charge an extreme  amount of transaction fees whereas my solution only collects necessary  data and charges the default routing fee of a lightning payment. It  might have some scalability issues at this time, it has not been fully  tested yet and is still in alpha. So I am not able to fully confirm the  functionality for thousands of users but I made it until here and I will  not fail at this point. While the back-end has covered almost  everything the application might lack a bit in UX. I suggest the 0815  user would like to see information such as\n\n* Spendable balance (total balance - funds sent to a payment channel)\n* Unconfirmed balance\n* Transaction history\n* Address\n* Public key\n* Private keys\n* Channel state\n* Channel capacity\n\nThink  like a normal user and tell me what you would like to see? Please give  me your brutal feedback so I can improve.

It's to hijack Bitcoin protocol by releasing modified malicious version of node software.

He is young and not too bright but we love him regardless. He had a $600 purchase on PayPal that he didn\u2019t remember making. He thought he must have just been really stoned and drunk one night. Nevertheless he reported it to PayPal, or so he thought. About a month later he got a phone call (at work) from a US marshal. He was on the phone for about 3 hours. Apparently there\u2019s a whole crew of bad actors on the phone. Because he went back and forth from IRS agents, secretaries, sheriffs, the works. They told him that he was wanted for drug trafficking and money laundering in Texas (this kid is 20 and still lives with his parents mind you). So he was scared as hell. They got him to give them his social security number, the works. Eventually they said that he got his identity stolen and that they would help him secure his money by freezing his bank account so that the \u201cfraudsters\u201d wouldn\u2019t be able to access it. So they told him to go and pull of his money out in cash and then go to a bitcoin atm and convert it and send them a backup of the private keys so they can keep track of the money just in case the hackers go after it. There wasn\u2019t a btc atm nearby so they said to go get google play cards from the nearest Best Buy. He did this. By the time he finished all of this I had just gotten to work and we were all wondering where the hell he had been for 3 hours. He was all stressed from the run around but relieved that his money was safe (it was about $800 since he had just gotten paid and was getting ready to pay rent). He told us the story and we were all like, oh shit dude, you just got robbed. Moral of the story is, the state, federal, or any other branch of government will never call you.

This experience helped me to understand the dynamics of this world. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPremise:  \nI don't discuss the potential of EOS sisterchains.\n\n**I don't want to spread shit about BPs some are very prepared and really believe in their work**. But I doubt the reasons why some BPs chose to invest in sisterchains and the management of these chains.\n\n# 5 reasons why sister chains can never compete with EOS \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **The sister chain is a secondary choice**. BP except for rare cases, have tried with little success to impose themselves on EOS. Someone is present on more than one sister, and more than the project is interested in speculation. \n2. **Most BPs have poor technical skills and Trusts are around the corner.** Some Bps ask for help from other BPs who ask for votes in return. The competition between BP is limited. Each sister chain has at most 100 active BPs.\n3. **0 marketing strategies.** There is no strong team behind it (such as [Block.one](https://Block.one)). The BPs are too weak and have no resources to do marketing. Some BPs have no team but are managed by only one person (or just a technician).\n4. **The price is bound to collapse.** Telos value speaks for itself. The sister chain tokens (except rare case) are airdropped: not everyone is interested in hold\n5. **BPs sell tokens (even if there are no volumes).** Do you know the meaning of vicious circle? In this moment we have a sequence of reciprocal cause and effect in which two (or more) elements intensify and aggravate each other, leading inexorably to a worsening of the situation. If the BPs sell their tokens, investors run away. If investors run away the price collapses. Sister chains don't have Bitcoin or EOS volumes. Many BPs (active or in standby) are not economically able to maintain server fees and are forced to sell their tokens, others become BPs just to speculate.  (Don't you belive it? Just an example on Telos blockchain you can see chainrift or akdex txs, many of txs start from BPs [https://telos.eosx.io/account/chainriftcom](https://telos.eosx.io/account/chainriftcom) / [https://telos.eosx.io/account/akdexiotelos](https://telos.eosx.io/account/akdexiotelos)). Many do it just to pay for server fees. But the result is a dangeorous vicious circle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe criticism that can be moved is that we are only at the beginning and in the future these problems will be solved. \n\nI know it, but also I believe we are no longer in 2016, only projects with competent teams and strong marketing skills will go ahead.

I put everything into maximizing my health, energy, weapon efficiency, and optimizing the weapon and damage subroutines to gold level.\n\n(Though since you're using the Gold cheat, and you'll already have every attribute maxed out and all subroutines at gold level: you should have enough room in the subroutine ring to keep all the defensive armor subroutines, with plenty of room to spare for other subs.)\n\nIf you don't already have them equipped: make room for Primitive Charge, Corrode, and MegaHurtz in your subroutine ring on the System Memory screen. All three will add considerably to the amount of damage you can inflict, especially since they all stack. Primitive Charge and MegaHurtz will have an immediate effect, while Corrode will keep wearing down your opponents for a while.\n\nBy maxing out your offensive capability, you should be able to eliminate the DataWraiths very quickly. If the first hit doesn't kill one, the second hit definitely will. Or, you can wait for Corrode to finish off that DataWraith.\n\nSince I play without the defensive armor subroutines, like Allronix stated: I use the environment, and find cover to shelter myself from attacks where possible. I can usually last long enough to survive a wave of attacks, and then lick my wounds afterward by recharging at Health and Energy Patch routines.

This is the 3rd or 4th time the price is taking a surge so lets get over all the flawed arguments once and for all.\n\n> 1) Bitcoin has no intrinsic value\n\nNothing has intrinsic value. Value is a matter of association. Gold has value because of its properties, just like that, bitcoin has value because of its properties.\n\n> 2) Bitcoin is slow and expensive\n\nBitcoin is opensource protocol and is always improving. Transaction fees are not very high these days but thats a price you pay for censorship resistant transactions compared to traditional banking like paypal. But don't worry, bitcoin's 2nd layer, Lightning Network is getting popular with practically 0 fees and instant transactions. Speaking from experience, Lightning Network actually works. Its not as easy to use but so wasn't the internet when it was new.\n\n> 3) Its used by criminals\n\nThis is exactly what people used to say about the internet. The internet turn out pretty used because its open. Bitcoin is an open platform to develop on. Sure, people use technology for bad, that doesn't make the technology bad. Instead of limiting what people can do, we should be focusing on creating better people. Infact, one of the number one usecase of bitcoin is charity and tipping (see pineaple fund and people on this subreddit).\n\n> 4) Its trying solve a problem that doesn't exist\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto in [his first release](http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source) of bitcoin talked about the trust that traditional banking breaches. Financial colapses happen everywhere and people loose everything because someone at the banks messed up. Excess inflation, like in Venezuela and Argentina, make people loose everything they have and often commit suicide while people at the top get away. Sure, just like climate change, it doesn't seem real until it actually affects you.\n\nBut bitcoin is so much more. It has ignited so much in multiple sciences and economics. **Bitcoin is no more what it was in 2009** and with the advances in layer 2 solutions like Lightning Network, which is *like* the HTTP of money, its like saying \"the technology to stream stupid cat videos on demand will never be usefull\".\n\nWith a download of an app and 2 button clicks, you become a part of a global economy. Bitcoin is worlds first global currency.\n\nIts about choice. If you want to use your national currency, go ahead.\n\n> 5) Bitcoin wastes a lot of energy\n\nBitcoin uses energy for proof of work to **secure its network**. The reason bitcoin is so valuable is because its so secure (ill get to speculation). This energy is used to establish mathematical truth. There are other alternatives to Proof of Work like Proof of Stake which uses a lot less energy. Layer 1 of Bitcoin uses Proof of Work as of now.\n\n> 6) There are other better cryptocurrecies than bitcoin\n\nThere is no other network as **secure** and robust as bitcoin.\n\n> 7) Bitcoins price is very volatile\n\nAs of today, yes. But its been observed that since its beginning bitcoin's volatility is gradually decreasing. Its often said that each consecutive bull run is less volatile than before (there has been 2-3 bull runs).\n\n> 8) Wasn't bitcoin dead?\n\n[bitcoin obituaries](https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin-obituaries/). Bitcoin will never die. Even if price falls to 0 (which it won't cause people **value** freedom), the network will never die. [also this obituary song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hlN2nel5HI).\n\n> 9) Bitcoin is a bubble\n\nBitcoins all time lows has always been orders higher than its prior all time highs.\n\nLocal bubbles exists. There are no global bubbles. Its only going up. (no guarentee, don't kill me if you lose you money. Understand before buying/earning)\n\n> 10) Bitcoin is open souce code so it can be just copy pasted so it has no value\n\nBitcoins code can be replicated. Not the network. Its the network thats real.\n\n> 11) Bitcoin is centralised\n\nA lot of big miners are mining pools. Sometime in 2013 (not sure) poeple realised one mining pool was about to cross 50% of hash power which made a lot of people to opt-out of that mining pool and it reduced its hash power a lot. I should also tell you that people often overestimate the dangers of centralisation. A centralised miner can only change the next block. Not the entire blockchain. Though bitcoin has never been successfully attacked with 51% attack.\n\nSo no, its not centralised, but not 100% idealy decentralised either. Practically, its decentralised.\n\n> 12) Bitcoin mining is making all my gaming GPUs expensive and I'm sad  >:(\n\nNo one uses GPUs for bitcoin mining (as of now), GPUs are for other cryptocurrencies. Though I should tell you computation is going to be very valuable. Mostly because of AI, big data, crypto and gaming. Which means greater demand. That doesn't mean better cheaper GPUs won't come.\n\n> 13) 5000$ per bitcoin is very expensive so how could people do transaction below 5000$\n\nBitcoin is divisible. The smallest transaction I've done is 0.01 satoshi which is 0.0000000001 bitcoin = 0.0000005278$ as of today.\n\n\nAll this not focusing about what bitcoin actually is. If you're here and are a noob. I hope you learn about bitcoin after this! <3", "@WendySiegelman @JaneMayerNYer Thats the exact same thing Peter Smith was doing.\nNo foul play.", "@QTVain Thank you!!!

If this isn't allowed in this sub, I apologize.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo start out, I am a 3D printing enthusiast based out of Washington, United States. I have been 3D printing for just over 4 years, and have done commissions for several happy customers - ranging from decorative items/toys, to functional parts for machines, even competition shooting equipment. I don't pretend to be an expert at it, but I'm good at what I do, and I'm confident enough to sell my work if someone wants to buy it... on an individual, one-off basis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have recently been offered a conditional contract by a major company in the United States (I'm not allowed to say who at this time). They would like me to produce a small component for them, which does not appear to be used for any particularly high temperature/high stress application. It is also a fairly simple part - in essence, a particularly-shaped bolt guide to fit between two pieces of metal. All it really does is guide some screws into place and has no worrying related safety issues. To my understanding, it is part of a package sorting mechanism. The original part is manufactured out of ABS (just ABS, no nylon or glass reinforcement). The problem for this company is, if they want to replace this small part (as it tends to wear out over time), they are unable to simply buy the one part - they have to replace the entire unit, which costs thousands of dollars. That's where I come in. This company would like me to produce as many of these little screw guides as reasonably possible (estimating around 1000-5000 units currently), and are willing to pay me quite well for it (I was promised a \"blank check\" a few times - obviously this is still being negotiated). It seems like a fantastic opportunity. However, I'm worried about IP/patent infringement from the original manufacturer. To be completely clear, the part I'd be making is essentially a cylinder with a rounded face on one side. This part is fairly simple in design, and I'm confident I could build a replacement part from common parts in anyone's garage, much less 3D printing them - to the point where a customer of the manufacturer could reasonably be expected to create a replacement piece on their own rather than purchasing the entire unit again because one small component wore out. Because of this, I have no fundamental qualms with making a bunch for this company... if this were on a one-off, non-contracted basis. However, as I would be in an on-the-books contract, I'm worried that there may be some legal repercussions if the manufacturer of this part found out that this company was outsourcing replacement parts, and would be able to easily find that I've been making the parts for them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know a lot of my liability would depend on the terms of the contract, but I've never been in a situation like this before, and while it's potentially very lucrative, I have my concerns (clearly). Has anyone else ever been in a situation like this before, and went through with it? How did it go? Did any problems like I'm thinking about come up, or am I over-thinking this? I'm aware that I can ask these questions while I'm negotiating the contract (and possibly get a stipulation added that this company will be liable for any possible legal repercussions), but I'm curious if anyone else here has done something like this before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!", "RT @lovesjackles: Adam, but just for a bit where his soul finally goes to heaven because I hate loose ends.

I think you mean you care about your \"stakeholders\".\n\n>\"Even if we love Ethereum and it was the community that we originated from, we are also looking into Polkadot\"\n\nIn other words, you think it makes sense to join forces with a private permissioned version of the Ethereum ecosystem to hedge your bets against the community that funded your project and made you all filthy rich. That's some fantastic loyalty and integrity right there. What could possibly go wrong by trying to get rich a second time by betraying your base?\n\nAragon's Polkadot play won't actually make \"decentralized organizations widespread\". That's just more inauthentic messaging. Parity's Web3 umbrella will be controlled by a very narrow group of stakeholders with DOT tokens (basically, Gavin Wood and his backers). That renders all inter-blockchain communication dependent on a plutocratic oligarchy. Public blockchains will become increasing centralized through this mechanism as more people use the underlying root chain for coordination. Organizations based on this kind of infrastructure will become vulnerable to all manner of meddling and disruption by the all-powerful DOT-holders. That's not the kind of infrastructure the public will have any legitimate reason to support. Thus, the organizations built atop this infrastructure will never become widespread.\n\n>\"CEO at Aragon One\"\n\nNeed I say more? This is literally an oxymoron.\n\n>\"I am writing this because I deeply care about Ethereum. Also because Aragon holds \\~0.25% of all ETH. I also hold ETH personally. So I\u2019d love for Ethereum to work out #tribalism\"\n\nI have yet to see evidence of that. I think you mean you \"deeply care\" about the riches that were carelessly dropped into your coffers. Also, having a sense of community or loyalty to a cause isn't \"tribalism\". It would be great if you and others stopped abusing this derogatory term to rationalize your own infidelities.\n\n>\"It\u2019s clear that developers are the end user of Ethereum\".\n\nIt's not \"clear\" at all. It's actually false. Developers take advantage of Ethereum in order to reach the end users. It's not complicated. If we expect Ethereum to amount to more than a shallow private club for coders then it needs to serve the interests of the wider public. If you expect any kind of adoption of this technology, then you must target the users first and foremost. The developers are the means to that end. So, you've got it entirely backwards.\n\n>\"the users wouldn\u2019t even notice they are using Ethereum\"\n\nThat's the very same line of thought that led people to start using Facebook and other walled gardens. Fooling people with a friendly and convenient UX doesn't legitimize your underlying tech stack, end-user license agreement, and so on. Enough with these deceptive practices.\n\n>\"The original plan (as heard from Ethereum cofounders) was to migrate the Ethereum Foundation funds into a DAO once the technology was ready. Now it is ready, so I propose that it\u2019s time to do so.\"\n\nThe original plan never identified the governance structure of this DAO. The reason it hasn't happened to this point isn't because of a lack of desire, but because the technology, and the community itself (by which I mean everyone with an interest in Ethereum, not just devs!), are still too immature and inexperienced to produce a viable and legitimate system.\n\nClaiming the Ethereum community is suddenly ready because Aragon has played around with a few corporate toy models is a joke of epic proportions, honestly. Aragon might know how to hack a few things together, but I highly doubt they understand good governance. Good governance in a \"public organization\" context isn't a product. It's a philosophy; or principle-based ideology for decision-making. The technology merely tries to embody this underlying logic. If you have a bad philosophy, you'll end up with bad governance and bad technology. Aragon has a terrible philosophy. In my opinion, it's selfish, corporate capitalism gone wild. Ergo, their approach to governance and technology will be similarly terrible. They admit as much when they say:\n\n>\"we certainly don\u2019t know what\u2019s the best governance mechanism for something like Ethereum\"\n\nAnd yet, they go on to attack the current informal governance process, proposing a \"committee system\" in its place. What's this committee system, you ask? Good question! Supposedly, it'll just be \"how it works today in a transparent manner\". Bullshit, I'm sorry. What Aragon has in mind here is formalized coin voting and little else. They haven't developed any real software to account for people's legitimate reasoning and democratic concerns, which is the only thing saving the current governance process from complete failure and tyranny!\n\nTo be very clear, our ability to voice our concerns and to actually be heard by the community at large, regardless of our perceived \"stake\" and \"status\", is what makes Ethereum governance different from other networks. It's the one saving grace keeping us in a somewhat respectable state. Sacrificing that democratic hope so that the entrenched inner circle of early adopters (the \"stakeholders\") can rule us more effectively is one of the most horrifying mistakes I can imagine.\n\nTLDR; Aragon is a deceptive untrustworthy corporate entity.

Its not working very well, takes forever to sync.  But, its peer reviewed....like everything else will be. - still running on one server, but promisses to be the most  decentralized of all. Some day... - The IOHK contract expires in 2020. - One of the only two dapps that were developing on cardano (sp8do)  moved to eos.  - Did i mention that they have a wallet?    \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome facts about eos: - running with NO FEES and INSTANT transactions (try gaming  sites...youll be amazed) on 21 Block Producers out of 500+ from which  the voters can choose from, every 2 minutes. - VC founds investing 100s of millions (Novogratz Galaxy digital 325  Million, $100m FinLab AG and BlockOne VC Fund, $50m SVK Crypto and B1  fund, $50m Tomorrow Blockchain opportunities fund, ...\\_\\_\\_).  - $1bn BlockOne commitment to fund Dapps in the Eco system (EOS VC  Initiative)  - $200m VC fund with Blockchain veterans Michael Cao and Winnie Liu,  which will make strategic investments in Asia-focused projects utilizing  EOSIO  - Bitmain's Jihan Wu investing heavy in BlockOne  - PayPal\u2019s Peter Thiel investing heavy in BlockOne  - Rob Jesudason, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Australia\u2019s  Commonwealth Bank (CBA), has left the bank to join BlockOne as chief  operating officer  - Tomorrow Ventures, a venture capital linked to former Alphabet Inc  chairman Eric Schmidt, is also involved.  - sister chains launching (Worbly, Telos, Eosforce, Boid, Evolution,  Eoseurope, BOS,..) They will eventually have inter-Blockchain  communication (IBC) which will be a revolution in speed and usability.  - Activision (call of duty, angry birds) and Mythical games giants  already building on eos. Mythical Games $16m founded by VC's.  - China government rated EOS number 1 crypto many times.  - Weiss Rating rated EOS number 1 crypto  - blocktivity shows - 87 million trx per day, more than all other crypto  combined and multiplied many times - in its inphancy (In comparison  Ethereum average 600k and Bitcoin average 500k)  - 17.000 trx pre pecond on testnet, beating every other project many  times over  - Wickipedia founder launched Everypedia on EOS, growing fast and  thinking on launching their own eos sister chain - DappRadar - most used dapps of all other crypto  - Second in number of developers, behind ethereum (not for long as they  are moving to eos) - free Airdrops and Airgrabs, worth 1/3 of the EOStokens in just 8  months and coming more and more frequent  - Bancor launched a decentralised exchange where you can trade ETH,  ERC20, EOS and all EOS airdrops directly beetween them, without fees  - many DEX exchanges where you can trade EOS airdrops directly from/to  your EOS account - no need to send them anywhere!! (jeah, really!) Eos  is growing a brand new internal blockchain market of its own. Many  tokens atm are only tradable in EOS.  - introducing EOSBTC, EOSETH and EOSUSDT..that act like eth, btc and  usdt stable coins, but on eos's blockchain speed  - Ledger Nano S integration, where you can set up Ledger to be your  active or owner key... and so protecting your eos account even if  someone steals your Ledger. A revolution in crypto security.  - 4,8 BILLION US DOLLARS warchest in CASH  - EOS's development funding is the only crypto that is not effected by  the bear market - BlockOne is the only one out there hireing lots of  developers in a bear market when others are laying them off.  - Many Dapps migrating from ETH to EOS (Sense coin, havven, texico,  medipedia, sentinel, Eos Dice bet,...). Even one of the only two dapps  developing on cardano just moved to eos (sp8do), publicly exposing  cardano as too complicated to build on.  - incredibly scalable (every future issue can be fixed easily without a  fork) - FORTH crypto in trading volume in a BEAR market (only behind BTC, ETH  and USDT)  - multiple exchanges adding EOS trading pairs regularly  - Blockchain with human readable names, makes transferes as easy as  possible  - Blockchain with top security, the first one with the so called 'owner'  and 'active' key pairs.  - one of the strongest and largest community there is. EOS reddit, EOS  telegram, a huge amount of sub communities too like for Block Producers,  Developers, Designers, people who just talk price action... Even the  individual block producers have their own communities, sister chains  have their own, dapps build on eos have their own communities... - Virginia Tech - the tech school where Dan Larimer is teaching young  troops on eos and blockchain...wait till they come out of there... - Chintai lending, where you can lent your eos resources for profit,  today.  - Huobi just launched a new exclusively EOS based exchange, where voting  and other things will be possible.  - referendum voting is on, the ultimate decentralisation.

It's people like you that give me hope.\n\n> A) Rather than BCH vs BTC, is it possible/reasonable to visualize a future where they both play big roles? Or does one eventually have to \"win out\" putting the other one out of business?\n\nExcellent question. There are strong forces that favor an outcome where one of the chains dwarfs the other (in terms of value, hashrate, userbase and market liquidity) in the long run. Most prominent one is \"network effect\": If one of those is more useful because more people accept/use it, then this fact alone should attract more users to it than to the other one. Also, it just doesn't make much sense to have one currency for day-to-day transactions and one for store of value. Why not use the transaction-one for sov also? As long as it has the properties necessary for store of value (like limited supply, fungibility and so on), which is true for BCH, there is no reason to use another coin for that.\n\n> B) Do you hold both for different reasons? Or have you gone all-in on one?\n\nI held pretty much only BTC before the BCH fork. Right after I swapped about 50% of my BTC to BCH (at higher-than-today prices), more over time. Also bought some other altcoins as hedges (monero, dash, cardano,...). I still hold about 30% (guesstimate) of my crypto-based value in BTC. The reasons being \n\n  * fear: core (less likely) or the BTC community (by way of \"firing\" core) might actually come to their senses and raise/remove the blocksize limit after all.\n  * BTCs role as \"central crypto\" for exchange purposes and most liquid fiat onramp plus it's (still very strong) network effect make it hard to let go.", "A company with a well documented history of poorly policing hate groups on its platform plans to introduce it's own https://t.co/WXTWL9g6JR", "Love: Sounds like cryptocurrency\n\nHate: Has little to nothing to do with cryptocurrency https://t.co/A4yLQrsScj", "RT @BhamShtyCouncil: Make sure you register for electronic billing that way we get your money quicker and continue to deliver awful service", "Free Sign Up\nPaid Daily Via Cash App,Paypal or Bitcoin\n\nThis App Is Paying You For Shit That Your Already Doing!\n\nC https://t.co/hRBkeb3J2S", "I hate these fake volume exchanges - i put my order in at 17:06 and since then.......nada, nothing, niente.  https://t.co/SYvw5M29NE", "I hate money &amp; want to learn zero of these things, but if you're in cryptocurrency to make money, you should probab https://t.co/e3uSdEYsLg", "Those guys are trash. Ever since the BCH fork/pump that rekt Bitcoin in 2017 the community knew these guys were garbage scammers. It is true that there are many shitcoins, but as this circus developed I realized what really makes this situation the worst of them is that their leadership actively manipulates and consistently acts fraudulently to profit and rek other coins. If people are naive enough to not DYOR then they deserve to get rekt via shitcoin gambling. Scamming these same people is a different story and I think that is what set the community off.\n\nHowever, I regretfully understand the argument in that banding together to vote that the exchanges drop these bad actors only exercises the power we give the Exchanges; most of which are pieces of shit themselves (volume manipulation, ect.) Delisting a coin, hence scrapping its trade volume and access to liquidity highlights the reality that in this phase of the cryptomarket maturation, the exchanges have the power to decide who gets to survive and who gets rekt; centralization at its finest. Maybe?\n\nIf everyone wanted BSV/BCHABC out, then we all sell the coin and never hold or trade it again. The resulting lack of volume would make the exchanges drop the coin as it would be \"dead\" in their space anyway. Wouldn't that be how a decentralized marketplace works? \n\nLastly, on a personal note - it was a pleasure, actually, it was fucking awesome to see the Bitcoin and Crypto community unite to put these cocksukers away.
