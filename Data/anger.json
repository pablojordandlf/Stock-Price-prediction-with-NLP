Anyway the minimum deposit was 50 dollars and i was not impressed because i was looking to deposit half of that.\n\nI was up in the morning with a text from a \"customer representative\" from aionmarkets which contacted me through whatsapp. I thought he was being just friendly at first but i soon realised he was trying to get me to start an investment plan. He says 500 dollars if i invested i would be making 5% daily profit guarenteed. (25$ a day). And there is better profit percentages more you deposit. I told him i was a broke ass student and can't just get 500 together like that. He kept asking me how much i had i say 20 dollars, he says deposit it which i do and i see tge balance change on the website later.\n\nHe made me a ridiculous offer like i can give you 300 if you can sort the rest and pay me from the profits which i soon disagreed with. I try to withdraw my money using the options on the website and it tells me at end step that i need to invest in a plan before i can get my own money.

I expect we will have quite a few people searching the net in the coming months / years as they study up on what all this stuff is. With the rise of state surveillance of blockchain transactions, the need for a truly free and private decentralized system will be more important than ever. I hope this bit of info helps you understand why XMR stands out among the rest of the blockchains today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI now exclusively only use XMR.  The fees are much cheaper than BTC for moving money around daily and its much more private. It is the only crypto that truly behaves like cash notes.   Monero uses different and stronger privacy methods in comparison to all the other privacy coins. It also uses a different Elliptic-curve than all of them. For example, BTC/ZEC/DASH all use secp256k1. It was created by the NSA. Monero uses an Elliptic-curve called edwards25519. ed25519 was created by the academic community and has been reviewed extensively from cryptographers for over 10 years and is widely deployed in the real world. I find it quite odd that Bitcoin was the first known application to use secp256k1.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMonero is much like Bitcoin was when it first began. No one owns or controls Monero. Its mining is currently more decentralized than Bitcoin. It has no centralized miners in China due to ASIC mining. Even the name Monero itself is from a decentralized language known as Esperanto.\n\nHow is Esperanto a \"decentralized language\", how is it similar to a decentralized currency ?\n\n* No country of reference\n* No central authority (there is an academy of Esperanto, a group of people who communicate and educate)\n* The possibility to cross ALL the borders of the world.\n* An agreed upon protocol. You can do minor changes and soft forks, but Esperanto's core is so well written you will have a hard time enhancing it. (Still there was a \"hard fork\" in 1907, but failed eventually)\n* The profound idea that we should all be able to interact without relying on some national authority (like I'm doing right now using the English language).\n\nEsperanto the language was created from scratch just like Moneros protocol. The language is closely related to many of the Romance languages. This is one reason I love Monero. I think psychologically it will appeal to a wider range of people around Earth. For example, these are the proportions of lexemes that are common to Esperanto and other languages: 91.64 percent French; 89.50 percent English; 89.12 percent Italian; 87.79 percent Portuguese; 87.12 percent Spanish; 81.70 percent German; 64.78 percent Latin; 53.26 percent Russian. There are Esperanto speakers in places you would never expect in every corner of the planet from China, India all the way to Africa. Esperanto was created in the late 1870s and early 1880s by L. L. Zamenhof, a Polish-Jewish ophthalmologist from Bialystok, then part of the Russian Empire, but now part of Poland. According to Zamenhof, he created the language to reduce the \"time and labour we spend in learning foreign tongues\" and to foster harmony between people from different countries.  \"Were there but an international language, all translations would be made into it alone\u00a0... and all nations would be united in a common brotherhood.\"  He opposed Zionism and occupation of Palestine and wanted Jews and Muslims to live in peace and harmony. He lived in a time of oppression of Jews and he started something called \"Homaranismo\".  Zamenhof wanted people to free their minds from the narrow fact that things such as a Jew, a Russian or a German even exist. He called for us to understand ourselves not as a part of a religion, language or a race but simply as human beings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are the first four dogmas of Homaranismo, the most principal and general:\n\n1. I am a human and I exist solely for purely human ideals; I view all sorts of ideals and targeted nationalisms as nothing but group egotism and hate towards people, which sooner or later must disappear and their disappearance I must be a catalyst to, to the best of my ability.\n2. I believe, that all populations are equal and I evaluate all people only by their personal value and deeds but not according to descent. For this I regard all persecutions carried out against others based on the fact that they were born to a different race, with a different language or religion as barbarism.\n3. I believe that every country does not belong to one or another race, but more justly to all its inhabitants, regardless of language or religion; I view the shuffling of interests of the land and the interests of one or the other race, language or religion as leftovers from barbaric times, when the fist and sword right was solely accepted.\n4. I believe that in one's own family one has indisputable, complete and natural right speak whichever language and dialect they may desire, and adhere to whichever religion they themselves choose, but in communications with people of different descent one should, when possible, use a neutral language and live according to also religion neutral principles. All striving of one person to impose one's language or religion onto others I view as a barbaric act.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome final thoughts....\n\nI have thought deeply about this over the years and I think the word \"Monero\" fits great for a currency...I am from India and although Esperanto does not closely relate to any language there, I find it very easy to learn and speak.  Esperanto could very well be a key language to know in the future. Like crypto, Esperanto is not only a \"structured thing\" created by us, it also creates a level playing field for everyone. Imagine going to a different country and not having to worry about learning a new language. Esperanto could be the default language of the universe. I am not saying forget your culture and your language, I am simply saying Esperanto could be a great extra language to help create better relationships and business ties across the globe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese are some of the reasons I love the Monero project.

I am not writing that the work they are doing is wrong, but I am proposing that they are missing out on a key opportunity to lead the global block chain and finance industry in the area of marketing.\n\nLet me give a brief overview of where the world is up to in regards to \u2018marketing\u2019. There are many academic circles, especially in America (looking at you, Harvard), that have not progressed very much in marketing academics past the 1960s (think *Mad Men* days). The ideas of Albert S. Humphreys, George Albert Smith Jr and Ronald Christensen (to name a few) from the 50s was that good business strategy is a fit between external forces and internal characteristics. This was massaged in the decades leading up to the famous work of Michael E. Porter in the 1980s-90s. If you have ever taken any business class, you\u2019re more than likely familiar with the name and work of Porter, but in essence Porter purports persistently that organisations compete by positioning themselves through focusing on \u2018cost leadership\u2019, \u2018differentiation\u2019 etc. and having \u2018competitive advantages\u2019 over the competition.\n\nAs I wrote, the work of Porter is famous the world over, and mostly went unchallenged; that is except for a man named Andrew Ehrenberg. Ehrenberg came from a statistics background in England, and although a lot of his work predates Porter, Porter\u2019s work undeniably spread far further. This is definitely not to say Porter\u2019s marketing views are unique; he is just the most famous one that holds and preaches them.\n\nPorter\u2019s work (inspired by those that came before) was created by looking at the success of business that came before, and what factors led to their successes. At best, it\u2019s guesses, at worst it\u2019s using survival bias as a tool for predicting future success.\n\nEhrenberg\u2019s work came from a social science statistics background with his whole mantra (and the whole mantra of the \u2018evidence-based\u2019 marketing movement) being that in order for something to be considered marketing science, it needs to hold true across all test conditions.\n\nHere are some examples of marketing laws you may not have heard of and how they would apply to the crypto space:\n\n1. User profiles of directly competing coins/tokens seldom differ.\n\nA user/holder/investor of Cardano is not different from a user of EOS or Bitcoin or Ethereum. They will all hold the same beliefs about their respective coin/token of choice (i.e. \u2018My coin\u2019s the best), and the most common consumers will see the coins/tokens as doing the same thing. Differentiation does not exist in the real world. (I remind you that if you are reading this post on r/cardano, you are not a \u2018common consumer\u2019, but a heavy user/thinker of crypto.)\n\nFor more, read: Uncles, M, Kennedy, R, Nenycz-Thiel, M, Singh, J & Kwok, S 2012, \u2018In 25 Years, Across 50 Categories, User Profiles for Directly Competing Brands Seldom Differ: Affirming Andrew Ehrenberg's Principles\u2019, Journal of Advertising Research, vol. 52, no. 2, pp. 252\u2013261.\n\n2. Coins share users in line with their market share size.\n\nBitcoin users are more likely to own Ethereum than Cardano. Less people are likely to have lots of Cardano and a little Bitcoin. (Once again, if you\u2019re a subscriber of r/cardano, you\u2019re not a usual market user, but skewed towards Cardano).\n\nFor more, read: Ehrenberg, Uncles & Goodhardt 2004, \u2018Understanding brand performance measures: using Dirichlet benchmarks\u2019, Journal of Business Research, vol. 57, no. 12, pp. 1307\u20131325.\n\n3. Coins with more market share attract light category users (natural monopoly).\n\nBitcoin gets all the new people to the crypto space because it\u2019s the biggest. (This one\u2019s a pretty well-known one).\n\nFor more, read: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural\\_monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_monopoly)\n\nSo to conclude, marketing does not have to be \u2018guesses\u2019 and \u2018see what has worked in history and hopefully it will work for Cardano\u2019, but there is opportunity for Cardano Foundation to show investors and users that investments are in a great place because every aspect, even the marketing, is evidence-based, peer-reviewed actions.\n\nTL;DR Cardano\u2019s marketing choices should be based on evidence-based marketing science.\n\nI\u2019m happy to answer any questions as best I can or point you in the right direction.", "@wikileaks This madness is now eternal, on the #blockchain forever:\n\nTweet: https://t.co/2h84h4c0t4\nArticle: https://t.co/Ke9tfEV1gT", "Cryptocurrency enthusiasts hate, and love, Libra coin via @FT\n https://t.co/Tq05QWZueE", "Im not in good mood right now im angry", "Why BitGo is the future of Blockchain without a CryptocurrencyMarket Mad House by @MarketMadhouse https://t.co/cTP1Z9b2gw", "BlockChannel: RT Disruptepreneur: Hate or love Facebook, if this isnt one of the most compelling illustrations of https://t.co/dMGMbaXH9e", "Most people that hate on bitcoin dont even know how a transaction works on a blockchain.", "You know what would be funny?\nIf btc dumped rn.

In 2018 everyone was talking about bitcoin, but with the price so high I didn't trust it yet. Felt it was booming because of people jumping in and that it would soon crash, which it did. About a month ago I started looking at bitcoin as an investment again, and everything seemed solid. I looked into wallets, how to purchase bitcoin, articles, everything, and I liked what I saw. For whatever reason that escapes me I forgot about it/neglected to follow up. This morning I randomly decided to check the price and it broke the threshold all of the articles I had seen were talking about. I decide I should buy now instead of waiting as just one month cost me about $1,000. Better to buy and forget then wait and wish I'd bought sooner. \n\nJust purchased a ledger S, says 2 day shipping. I will be leaving Wednesday night for out of town, so I may miss the package. My question was should I buy bitcoin now through something like coinbase then transfer it to my wallet when I get it, or should I wait until I get my wallet to purchase any bitcoin for security? Asking because I'd hate to miss the package wednesday, then come back next monday and the price tests the waters at $6,000 and I'm out another $7-800.

But YOU are the one who is having a fast one pulled on you here, not the government.\n\nThe fact that these loans are tax free is about as relevant as the \"fat free\" label I often see on Halloween candy.  \"Fat free\" candy corn will not keep you from getting fat, and a \"tax free\" crypto-collateral loan is not a way to sell cryptocurrency without paying taxes.\n\nThere is no loophole for you here.  This is not a SALE.  It's a LOAN.  That means you have to pay it back!\n\nWhat this is is a loan where you put up cryptocurrency for collateral.  You will have to pay back the fiat you borrow, the principle, plus interest.  But it's worse than that.  If the cryptocurrency you put up as collateral goes down in value you will also have to send them MORE cryptocurrency to top it off back up to the original value.  The LENDER is perfectly shielded from the risk of the volatility of the cryptocurrency here, and YOU are EXPOSED to it!  You would be better off just getting credit cards or a loan at your bank if you need short term cash.\n\nThese loans are a great deal for the lenders, I'm sure, and I'm positive they are going to be mad at people like me who point out who this works and point out how they are trying to manipulate you with this \"tax free\" marketing speak.  Don't fall for it!  I won't you guys to be healthy financially - not in hock up to your eyeballs without a Satoshi to show for it.", "RT @AkadoSang: Also note that:\n\n- Ian Balina mad at alts \n- Tone Vays is expecting an 80% correction\n- Peter Brandt is expecting an 80% cor", "Mad science by mad scientists, $xrp is not decentralized.  \nCTO David Schwartz says XRP is absolutely not controlle https://t.co/VCs3bgolay", "I applaud most of this document. It seems far more sincere and even-handed. So, bravo and thank you for the tone of your messaging. With that said, there still appears to be a great deal of subjectivity involved in the current moderation practices. For instance, I find it very problematic to claim /r/Ethereum aims to be a place \"...void of hate, vitriol, insults, slurs, threats of violence, witch hunts\". I believe this perpetuates a form of pseudo-common sense that will be used as justification to police people's free speech. That is, I don't believe the moderators should be using their subjective sense of what is 'acceptable', 'civil', and 'polite' as a means of ideological regulation. Your idea of 'hatred' and 'vitriol' may just be other people's sense of satire and political dissent. Your idea of a 'witch hunt' may be a tool to protect people who are far from innocent. You get my point, I hope. All this is a very dangerous, implicitly authoritarian slippery slope for the moderators to go down and I would really hope this community can rise above this kind of veiled social control.\n\n>\"Ideally, if there is a large calling for a moderator to be removed, the moderator in question will voluntarily step down. Doing so should not be interpreted as the moderator agreeing with or admitting fault to the claims presented, but simply that the moderator is willing to sacrifice their position in order to avoid further conflict and distraction\"\n\nThe calls to remove Ryan Zurrer as a moderator have been significant. They represent a wide variety community view points, which many would argue have been fair and respectful, on the whole. Whether he wishes to recognize it or not, it's the community will to remove him as a moderator on /r/ethereum on account of the fact that he has a very obvious preferential commitment to Polkadot and the Web3 Foundation, which many of us consider to be misaligned with the Ethereum ecosystem. Ryan's refusal to step down in a responsible way has taxed people's patience and good will. It does injury to the community's voice and makes us appear weak and subservient to elitists. In my sincere opinion, this will to remove Ryan is not a product of maximalism or malicious intent. Many of us embrace a radical and freedom-loving diversity, but there's only so much open mindedness we can accommodate before our brains fall out of our skulls.", "Pacer sucks balls.\n\nIs there another good place to follow the court records on this case?", "I fucking hate Lee Thomas wack ass", "I hate everything about this.\n\n\"[Scientists] are using a blockchain-enabled decentralized time banking system (Blen https://t.co/Sx2O8jzI55", "@erst69 $XRP is for the banks and I hate banks. #Cryptocurrency is supposed to get rid of those lying assholes even https://t.co/oU8QkeC8qL", "Tron 'Partners' With Local Police Against Angry Mob at Beijing Office https://t.co/rCgTIZf3si #bitcoin #blockchain #fintech", "I know the feds fucken hate blockchain. but why can't we put a protocol. let's throw in some fucken math. and stimu https://t.co/TEFamQv35a", "@2ndOldest What bring us a good blockchain without an official wallet!?!??

Unavoidable. \nWith or without RBF, you still have to trust that a miner won't replace one tx for its duplicate with a higher fee. Miners dont have to honor the original tx to the merchant, in fact it's in their financial interest not to do so.

It's no longer the peer-to-peer electronic cash system being described in the white paper.\n\nWhat took you so long to realize this you might ask? Well, being around Bitcoin and using it since 2010/2011 made me hate the idea of forks. If it wasn't BTC, I didn't consider it to be Bitcoin despite being better in many ways. The BTC community bashing Bitcoin Cash whenever they can didn't make it easier either. It even got so bad that I've been wearing Blockstream merch for the last couple of months.

You don't start censoring people and call them scammers as soon as they have another view on things. \n\nLet's spend 2019 improving Bitcoin Cash and its adoption.

This happened August 1st 2017.\n\nThe fork was pretty much 3 things: segwit removal, 8 mb blocks and an EDA algo so that bitmain could game the PoW difficulty and profit from it. Quick obs in this connection: a true fork would leave the difficulty untouched so miners would need to choose organically.\n\nThe flippening attempt happened during october 2017 for those who forgot. Don't you think that wasn't dangerous, because it was dangerous. IIRC BTC fell from ~8k to ~5k and BCH went from sub ~1k to ~2.5K.\n\nNow recall that segwit2x was cancelled on **November** 8th 2017, way after RV was behind BCH and after the flippening attempt through market pump happened. \n\nHere are some links: way before segwit2x was scheduled to happen, and right after BCH forked, [Roger Ver was already supporting BCH as early as August 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkbSrmsYJ9c&t=2647s). And [RV started openly promoting BCH since September 2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/72bknj/bitcoincom_is_now_promoting_bitcoin_cash_at_all/).\n\nSo, what was segwit2x? In my personal opinion, it is was a futures market scam. They sold the futures and cancelled, so that a lot of people lost ALL the money and they made a fortune.\n\nNow, things simply don't add up: flippening attempt and BCH support **before** segwit2x, but in social media the biggest support base from the big blockers was for segwit2x? Segwit is like the plague in rBTC, the most horrible thing in the world, but they were fully supporting Segwit2x, which is obviously segwit but with a small block increase (not even close to the 100 meg blocks RV is saying are needed to save the BABies hum?)\n\nAre you smelling the bullshit already?\n\nNow take a look at what notorious rBTC shills are saying: https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/bgwh9t/freetrader_who_wrote_the_intial_bitcoin_cash/eloa15l/\n\nThey are trying to downplay what in my opinion was a very clear futures market scam run by RV (+ very likely Vorhees and others behind the cancellation).\n\n**I think this is important for the bitcoin community as a whole.** They are lying straight-face that RV just magically happened to find BCH fork, think it was very cool and that it would \"save the BABies\", and that AFTER segwit2x was cancelled RV went full BCH and started to hate segwit. **This is provably a lie according to the links above.**\n\n\n***\n\nWhy all of this happened? Now it comes the second, and most important, part: bitmain tried an IPO heist in HK. Their valuation model was clear: an huge bag of overpriced BCH that would be indirectly dumped onto the IPO investors by collecting money from stock sales priced on inflated BCH. They knew their books were cooked and embezzled by overpriced crypto holdings. \n\nOverpriced how? One simple way (not saying this was the scam, but possibly): give S9 to big miners in exchange of tons of BCH fork coins, price that back in retail S9 price.\n\nOn March 26, 2019, [Bitmain lost their IPO](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitmains-ipo-filing-has-expired/). Now ask yourself: what those coins became? They became **liabilities**. Ask yourself another thing: when did the last BAB pump happened? Weeks prior to their IPO loss. Coincidence?\n\nNow let's see the final hallmark of a scam, which is tech: BAB is implementing the schnorr-without-benefits fork in May, which is copy&paste of blockstream work. None of the shilled ABC roadmap has been delivered so far. What BAB has now is: a few parameters changed to increase max block to 32 MB (anyone can do); cashAddr which is pretty much bad UX with no benefits (anyone can do, it is just a stupid mask); CTOR that yields nothing without the rest of their promised vaporware, and with it the marginal improvement is negligible anyway; another DAA algo because the marvelous devs realized their previous EDA would make them even more susceptible to a 51% attack (if you cannot flip, you can be flipped, simple).\n\nThe cherry on the top is rolling checkpoints, implemented unilaterally without consensus: a rolling checkpoint is simply a bunch of colluded miners agreeing to follow each other's mined blocks at height x-11. **That's really what this is**, but disguised as an \"anti-reorg feature\". Guess what, any centralized shitcoin has the same \"anti-reorg feature\", right?\n\nIn sum: BCH was used for a series of clear scams, some of which worked very well (segwit2x cancellation scam), some of which failed (IPO attempt) and some of which were a win-win game (flippening attempt failing, insiders dumped; coinbase surprise listing, insiders dumped). \n\nIt is definitely [dishonestly marketed](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ay4nu3/north_queenslandaustralia_bch_adoption_may_be_a/). RV is only interested in peddling scams like an [ICO with 70% premine not even launched in his marvelous BCH token platform](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/auj9jx/im_now_an_official_advisor_for_livenpay_a_food/). Not long ago RV was also shilling BSV, [believe it or not!!!](https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/1090981547144994816).\n\nI know this sub doesn't buy into rBTC, RV or bitmain's crap, but it doesn't hurt leaving a remainder here.

I'm definitely in favor of the idea in principle, but we're talking about altering the pre-existing social contract on a live chain. What right do developers have to introduce a very subjective and experimental mechanism to tax the community? Who's to blame for the lack of funding, in the first place?\n\nIt appears to me if the distribution of ether were more egalitarian  from the start, more developers would have received their fair share. That is, if these reserves were prudently spent and managed by the leadership, there should be no need for this contentious retroactive tax policy. Do we have any actual evidence this is the case? Have public funds really been improperly disbursed? Or is it jealously, fear of inadequacy, unrealistic expectations, and so on, that's motivating this?\n\nIf the funds were unfairly hoarded and kept out of the hands of the developers, then perhaps this is a legitimate move, but I don't believe that case has been made in any convincing and public way. On the other hand, if the developer's are simply plotting to extract as much as they can from the community (by incrementally ratcheting such a value extraction mechanism), then obviously we're going to resist. People will spin this into a \"developer bailout\" and they'll have a real point (unlike the DAO hard fork). Generally speaking, crypto folk absolutely hate socializing losses; they hate corruption, inefficiency, and taxation.

This results in Geth falling back to full sync for the main chain, taking too much time.\n\nThis attack can only be meaningfully mounted against nodes which are properly exposed on a public IP address (i.e. not firewalled, not NATed). Even then, it's a race against the node finding good peers fast enough, in which case the attack doesn't work any more.\n\nThere is no economic advantage in pulling this attack off, only causing sync annoyance. That said, there is currently a number of (at least 4 identified, maybe more) Parity nodes at `207.148.5.229`, which are doing variations of this attack. It might be deliberate, or it might also be leftover nodes from some experiment that only have a few blocks on their chain and subsequently disabled sync. A bit unprobable.\n\n## Solution\n\nThis release repurposes the DAO challenge to do a checkpoint challenge based on the recently hard coded CHTs. It also makes the challenge stricter, in that while the node is doing a fast-sync, remote peers are not permitted to be synced below the checkpoint block. This should also help sync the chain faster, getting rid of stalling or useless peers.\n\n---\n\n**Geth binaries and mobile libraries are available on the [Geth download page](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads).**", "@CryptoCobain Saw this coming!

Dont they tend to devaluate it in order to get higher their own exchange-coins (aka BANK-COINS!), to CONTROL the market AND the CUSTOMERS as far as it can.\n\nThe problem is that the big part of cryptoadopters are some kind of \"investors\", \"traders\", profit-hunters. It has nothing to do with BITCOIN. So they can go ahead and invest in BNB and whichever else BaNkCoin. Thats the shortest way to devaluate and eliminate BTC. BTC is NOT about that. Its for FREEDOM (dont read financial-freedom), and if its not so important for You, go ahead and \"invest\" in BNB. Next we can see how some customers are banned just because they tweeted something \"wrong\" about some big player, or some wallets become blocked just because the owned run an website named crypto-leaks with very unpleasure information about the big players.. \n\n#deletecoinbase was a big thing, however very poor supported by the community. I hope we can wake up before to be too late.

This is meant to be a bigger discussion of the goals and ideals of crypto, some things I've noticed in general and the questions that it brings up for me. \n\nIn the last little while when I come to r/btc, I see lots of conversations that seem to follow some of these issues:\n\n- r/bitcoin and their censorship\n- BCH is great, allows open discussion and has great tools for a decentralized future\n- Hype for decentralized exchanges and removing the power from centralized exchanges\n- Anger towards certain people being kicked from popular centralized platforms (Twitter, Facebook, Patreon, Youtube, etc)\n- Ideas and replacements for the above platforms that are not censored\n- etc. etc.\n\nYou know what I mean. If I were to put it into \"We should move towards a decentralized future to ensure that we can't be censored again\".\n\n...\n\nAnd then today. We go and the top 5 stories are about different exchanges delisting SV. I go into the comments and read things like:\n__________________________\n\"_Apparently the market is not taking kindly to the BSV principals suing everyone._\" - My first thought: No the centralized exchanges aren't. The markets was still using it.\n\n\n\"_BSV is getting delisted from Binance, Shapeshift, and probably Kraken. Hopefully more exchanges follow._\" - First thought: How is this any different than guys like Jordan Peterson or Alex Jones getting banned from Patreon, Youtube, etc?\n\n\"_I can't help but feel the true supporters of Satoshi's vision (BCH) really did well._\" - First thought: Very true. But was this the work of the market or the work of exchanges?\n\n\"_Best news all year. Love seeing the crypto community band together and oust this group of crooks. Major, major props to Binance._\" - First thought: So if we don't like it we get rid of it?\n\n\"_The fact that BSV was added to any exchange in the first place baffles my mind._\" - First thought: What would happen if it were a DEX?\n\n_____________________________\n\nTo be clear - I am in **NO** way a Craig Wright or SV supporter. I thought it was crap from the get go. Maybe there are two groups of people on this sub - one fighting for a decentralized future and another who is cheering on the SV delisting - but (on a guess) I think that the two groups are pretty close to the same.  \n\nBut it gets me thinking about a decentralized future, what it brings and what it means to be truly uncensored and let the market decide.\n\nEveryone has opinions. Many of them differ. It's really easy to see when your own opinion is being stifled (see r/bitcoin). It's not always to easy to see when you are cheering it on (see SV). Especially if the end result is better for everyone in the end (see SV). \n\nThe market, by and large, is stupid. Look at the amount of scam coins, fake ICOs, etc. that have been incredibly successful in the last few years. \n\nIn a decentralized world, how do you deal with that? How can you stop the SVs? The scam ICOs? The Bitconnects? We could educate - but people will slip through. We could let the market correct, but how long would that take? And if there's one thing I've learned there will always be a better scammer. We could find a way to \"de-list\" but that goes against the whole idea of the thing doesn't it? \n\nOr is this a non-binary question - is there some level of centralization (ie. Power) that needs to be retained in order to prevent this? And who would check that power? How would they check it? How would it be uncorruptable?\n\n\nObviously all of these are very open ended questions. I know how I feel on a lot of them - but I'm not entirely sold that my feelings are correct or valid. I agree with the removal of BSV, Alex Jones and Jordan Peterson - but is this one of those \"and then they came for me\" moments? Are they predatory people preying on the unsuspecting public or do they really believe in their opinions?\n\nI only ask because these are tough questions that we should be asking ourselves as we're guided towards the future. What are your thoughts? I'd love to hear them.", "@SusanTFor @USATODAY Hate to see Adam go ,welcome  back qwen", "Hate this :X \"Blockchain Sister Startups Allegedly Pull $8 Million Exit Scam\" by @cointelegraph https://t.co/oBCLwJh2CE", "Chelsea, really?

Actually doing transactions with it isn't the main concern.\n\nBCH: Mostly concerned with being able to use BCH as a currency, so prioritizing fast transactions speeds and low fees.\n\nIn my limited experience it indeed seems like BCH moves around quicker and has lower fees, so it seems like it's accomplishing this goal. On the flipside, BTC people seem to be more concerned with just holding an asset that can appreciate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLooking around on both Reddit and Youtube, you hear all kinds of conflicting info. Some conflicting claims I've seen recently:\n\n**1)** \"*Lightning Network is a bandaid tacked on to solve a problem but can't actually solve it because it's a layer on top of the network, so it sucks.*\" vs \"*Lightning network has revolutionized and renewed everything! BTC forever!*\"\n\n**2)** \"*BCH volume and acceptance is way down, and it's on it's way out*.\" (Despite CoinMarketCap and monthly/yearly charts showing the opposite.) Saw some posts on Reddit yesterday saying \"*Someone who uses BCH in 2019? LOL NOOB*\". BCH is still ranked #4 on CoinMC above many other growing coins, so it doesn't seem like it's exactly on it's \"way out\"...\n\n**3)** \"*BCH is just a splinter of the real thing, so it's stupid*\" seems to be a pretty strong sentiment among BTC-purists. Though it is a splinter, it does seem to actually be more useful as a currency than BTC...\n\n**4)** Seems recently that the further split of BCHABC and the other one has made BCH lose even more credibility among broad-market observers, while those in the trenches seem to say \"*Each splinter is another step in the evolution of making the perfect crypto!*\"\n\nAll in all it's surprising how this whole debate and constant back-and-forth almost puts democrat-vs-republic loyalist fighting to shame. It borders on mind-controlled cult zealot levels, making it hard to push through all the opinions and facts. Another difficulty is that almost every time someone is saying something about a specific crypto, it's biased because they're invested in that one.\n\nSo I guess my questions are (and I realized which subreddit I'm asking this in, so I expect some bias, but would love to hear your thoughts...):\n\n**A)** Rather than BCH vs BTC, is it possible/reasonable to visualize a future where they both play big roles? Or does one eventually have to \"win out\" putting the other one out of business?\n\n**B)** Do you hold both for different reasons? Or have you gone all-in on one?\n\n**C)** If you're all-in on BCH, is your primary reason for choosing it the fact that it's useful as a currency? Or are you also aiming to have it appreciate drastically to boost your portfolio so you can switch to cash at some point?\n\nSuper long and winding post, but any feedback would be helpful for me to move forward!\n\nThanks in advance!", "Most libertarians get angry for taxes, monopolies, subsidies etc. Yet most of them completely ignore the real fight https://t.co/UcYZY2kdB4", "@thevoiceuk @jimmybalito I really hate that song (for very personal reasons) BUT OMG Jimmy your version just change https://t.co/QcUgtJcUEe", "RT @TheAliceSmith: I hate banks.

If that's the case, no individual alone can be Satoshi even if he can move those coins. The key of the genesis address (and the block) may be created by the group together, may be shared in the group after created by one of them (for bookkeeping for example), and may be given to another member for some reason (because quitting for example).\n\nWith that being said, I do think Scronty aligns with the inventor/creator of Bitcoin from every aspect. There are some errors and inconsistencies in his Bitcoin Origins story, which were pointed out by the community, but none bothers me because it's written years later without any written records to reference, as is said. I haven't finished reading the story, though. There is one (and one only) matter in all his statements that makes me suspect he's lying: he said (on another occasion than the video in the link) that he backdated the key that Craig used to prove himself being Satoshi *and he told Dave that it's how they could catch Craig cheating*. This is unlikely because Craig was Dave's friend while he was not. But I think he might have done it to troll and anger Craig.\n\nThere is one specific detail that makes me lean towards the idea that Scronty was the main creator (at least in writing the white paper and coding the software). At around 1:10:00 in the video, he mentioned a change of wording in the old (draft) white paper: from \"broadcasted\" to \"broadcast\". I checked both versions. He was not wrong. In addition, according to him, Craig didn't notice and has made a mistake by using the new (formal) version. I doubt many in the community noticed it. This is to say Scronty (or Dave) is likely the writer of the white paper. In addition to the white paper, there is a comment with the wording \"broadcasted\" in the source code in the early versions. The following code is from Cryddit's pre-sourcesorge files found on bitcointalk:\n\n`// The basic transaction that is broadcasted on the network and contained in`  \n`// blocks.\u00a0 A transaction can contain multiple inputs and outputs.`  \n`//`  \n`class CTransaction`  \n\nThis is to say Scronty (or Dave) is likely the coder of the initial software.", "RT @satoshi_studio: Family portrait  #manufacturing #Crypto #leather #shapes #photography #sneakers #handcrafted #europe #satoshione #mad", "New post: Mad Crypto: A post-Blockchain Week explainer about bitcoins price  The Block Crypto https://t.co/iNHVhENBER", "@Albabycakes I think it's become the \"smart basketball guy\" take that you have to hate Russ because of his contract https://t.co/KPh4O4n8AR", "@CryptoCobain Jordan, they must be angry cryptic bots https://t.co/FuLuhbTUl4", "Well that sucks to wake up to, bouncing back from 5k instead of lower though.

Now lets get to the topic of this thread.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me start with my own story. I was aware of the Bitcoin Cash hard fork coming in 2017 and I had my Bitcoin ready for the fork. After the fork for about a week of patiently waiting and researching how to safely transfer my Bitcoin before claiming my Bitcoin Cash, I did so. Not too long after that, I was amazed at how or even why I instantly had additional value in my crypto portfolio because of this Bitcoin Cash. But I thought to myself. \"I'm not gonna use this thing, I'm still using and saving my Bitcoin. F\\_ck it, I'm going to sell it for more Bitcoin\".  And I did just that. I got X% more Bitcoin and I was like \"thanks for that\". Then about December of 2017 when the bull rally was peaking, I can honestly say that I did have a little regret or remorse for selling my Bitcoin Cash. I thought \"Aww man. If I had kept my 1:1 BTC+BCH then my portfolio would be even bigger right now\". But I didn't let it bother me I accepted my decision at the time and I moved on with my life. Fast forward to the past few weeks up to today of me writing this thread, I take back that regret and I am 100% accepting of my decision to sell my Bitcoin Cash and I am actually very happy that I did. Honestly I am 100% happy with my selling of BCH after the hard fork and getting more BTC. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet explain why. Most of the reason why comes down to data and a few fundamentals. On 1 August 2017 at Block number 478,558 Bitcoin had its first ever hard fork and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) started its own blockchain with its own rules and a code similar to Bitcoin, but still different and non-compatible. At that block, Bitcoin's supply was approximately 16,484,738 and all of a sudden Bitcoin Cash had a supply of 16,484,738 also. All BCH did was basically \"copy + paste\" the blockchain prior to the hard fork block. Its a copy, a phony, a fake, a rip off, a knock off. There was no actual work or especially any Proof Of Work (POW) for BCH's coin supply of 1 up to 16,484,738. Think about it for a minute. There is NO REAL genesis block for BCH! No, STOP reading for a moment and think about what I just said. The supply of BCH from 1 to 16,484,738 has a true and honest value of Sh\\_t. Really it does. Where is the worth for that coin supply range? Where is the VALUE? There is none! Now in all fairness with BCH, the only actual value that I can honestly see is from the coin supply of 16,484,738 to today of approximately 17,717,100 (time of my writing, plus or minus a few blocks) which is only a coin supply of approximately 1,232,362. That is the only real value that I see with BCH and its blockchain and there miners doing work. I think its funny that Traders today think that BCH should be trading at about $300 or 0.0585xxxx BTC? Really? Wow! Given the stats I just gave you then the fair market cap of Bitcoin Cash that has any actual value should only really be worth about $369,708,600. That puts BCH back to about # 26 on coinmarketcap. And My same logic and theory goes for BTG, BSV, LCC and any of these hard forked coins. Just copy + pasted blockchains. OK, so why didn't some of the value of BTC get subtracted to fulfill the value gap between BTC and BCH? Sit on that thought for a moment too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow you might be thinking or saying \"3Lb4ZRGPAq6Xfo doesn't know what he is talking and he doesn't understand the technology and blockchains and he doesn't understand what Satoshi really wanted for Bitcoin. And he doesn't understand that BCH blocks handle more and there's practically no fees for sending BCH. And, and, and BCH is the 'real bitcoin', not BTC\". Yea, yea, yea, bla bla bla. STFU. Listen... No one needs to be a Techie to understand everything I mentioned above. Satoshi wrote the code for Bitcoin and he/she/they executed it at block 1, a REAL Genesis Block! So you're trying to me... that back in the day when I could mine BTC on my home PC computer that I was also mining BCH at the same time also? And I didn't even know it?! Neither did Satoshi? WOW! AMAZING!!! (as I roll my eyes and shake my head). You can't fool me. I'm not stupid, I'm not an idiot and I'm not a dumb\\_ss.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRegarding Bitcoin, sure there's been updates and bugs taken care and a few second layer solutions and SegWit and Lightning and all that authentic and original and \"organically\" performed work done for Bitcoin. I applaud Satoshi and any/all developers for Bitcoin. I believe in POW. I believe in Bitcoin. I believe in Litecoin which also had its own genesis block. I believe in Zcash which again, also had its own genesis block. I also believe in Gold and Silver. I don't believe in BCH, BTG, BSV, LCC, USD, EUR, YEN, USDT or Gov Central Banks. I don't believe in anything that can not prove value like any of those things. Hence why we love \"Proof Of Work\" (POW). At this point, I can only think that BCH only has a specific use case. Which means that I need to trade some BTC or LTC for BCH and then send it. Why? because I need to send crypto super fast or because I'm a cheapskate and I can't afford a small 0.0x% fee for sending a transaction? Well I'm not a cheapskate. Lightning project is also coming along. I admit its a bit technical at the moment, but let it organically mature and grow, its going to be fine. Segwit has been working just fine for me. If I really need crypto sent and confirmed right freaking now within milliseconds, then I can use lightning, or LTC, or DASH's InstantSend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you get it now? Do you see BCH's real value? No, you still don't? OK. Give me your hand while I walk you across the street. Lets use one more example that most of us should be familiar with. Although the mechanics of this example are different to BCH vs. crypto, its value comparison is right on. Where does most of today's fiat currency come from? Lets use the US dollar for this example. In basic terms, the Government creates a bond and sells that bond to the Federal Reserve (that doesn't have anything on their balance sheet) and poof! USD currency magically springs into existence. Wow! Where is the worth for that magic poof fiat currency? Where is the value? Do you get it now? We all know there are other factors regarding debt attached to that fiat and fractional reserve banking, but that is beyond the topic of this thread and everyone should already know about that by now and if not, please educate a friend or family member.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion to this thread, I feel that Bitcoin Cash will go down in the crypto history books along with Mt.Gox and Bitconnect and QuadrigaCX. Or maybe I'm completely wrong... But I doubt it. Only you and the free market will decide in the end. I believe in and I am invested in the other above mentioned crypto and I will trade some other altcoins, but I have no desire to even trade BCH. I did not write this thread as a stunt or market mover or for donations. I just want to share it with you and with the world. Although if one has a good point to be made or good idea, then I believe that one can also be rewarded or accept donations if you found this topic worth while or... if it... \"HAS VALUE\"! This whole concept has been on my mind for a few weeks now and I needed to share it with the world. If you agree with me or disagree is irrelevant. You can reply all you want to this thread or be angry with me or tell me off all you want. It can't and won't bother me, so I am saving you typing energy ha ha.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember, If you agree with what you read or like what I had to say, please do one of the following or both.\n\n1) Share this thread.

It's required for LN to scale, and the LN whitepaper itself calls for a blocksize increase. The question is when to do it. Having a contentious hard fork to get a bigger blocksize is just a terrible idea. You need to get consensus, or else you have a BSV/BCH situation where you have factions basically chopping up market share, intellectual power, and developers of the coin into competing forks. It's nonsense. Eventually, Bitcoin will get to a point where an overwhelming majority come to the conclusion a blocksize increase is mandatory. Right now, it's not. And I understand that is just an opinion - we can disagree, that's ok - but clearly, based on the data, more and more people have consistently sided with Bitcoin over BCH, as evidenced by the Bitcoin/BCH price since BCH hit it's all time high: https://imgur.com/0AjJy8I\n\nLN is still a long ways off from being perfect, but it's also come a long way.

The logic is something like the market thinks Core's engineering is top notch, usually phrased like \"Well the market thinks LN is a viable L2\" or \"there are plenty of software engineers that think it will work\".\n\nThe problem with these type of arguments is they assume the market knows how to do engineering or that engineers somehow make better traders. I can tell you quite confidently that understanding what hash functions are and how TCP works does not help me trade Bitcoin, quite the opposite actually. People have their reasons. Markets are more about feelings than facts. Being ahead of the curve by 2 years is the same as being 100% wrong.\n\nBut these days, instead of making me angry(because the market is irrational), the emotional thinking of core holders is starting to make me chuckle. At the next bottom(I'm thinking $220 at the moment), buying BTC will present you with a certain upside and BCH another. The chance of being right about the timing will be identical(e.g. a 60% chance to correctly predict the next bottom) but the upside will be 2x vs 1.25x, so why would anyone buy BTC at the bottom if \"price makes right\".\n\nAre all the new market entrants going to give a crap about the name \"Bitcoin\" or are they going to do a bit of research and find that one side can't answer basic questions about the lightning network while they sacrifice 50% because \"decentralization\"?\n\nTA is the only tool being used in crypto, TA is supposed to be asset agnostic. But, for some reason the top TA shills continually make value judgements about the underlying assets. You better not trade that assending triangle in BCH because it's a \"shitcoin\". Do you think Tone Vays is dumb enough to trade BTC and let an extra 50% upside go because it's a \"shitcoin\"?\n\nDo you think the wisest traders are afraid of BCH at this point because of a potential hash attack?\n\nAll that is why \"price makes right\" arguments are weak. First, they assume the market is rational, and second, they crumble the moment a bull market begins. If the market was truly rational, BCH would rise to BTC's value the moment the bottom is in. The fact that it doesn't proves that many BTC holders are still not thinking rationally. The extra risk of a hash attack does not justify a value at 5% of BTC and the market will trend that way for the next 1 to 3 years. \n\nBCH $500 or BTC $6k first?

My goal is to at some point change that over time; to prove our worth as an industry and provide value to people using the blockchain as a medium.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe book is an easy read, and has references to why prediction markets wont work. Inside of the book he talks about common sense, and how it fails us for large scale problems. We're going to only focus on the prediction side in this piece. If I get a reasonable response for this (not necessarily a good one), I'll write more about complexity economics, social complexity and systems theory.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Reasons Why Prediction Markets Won't Work\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. Predicting Large Complex Systems Is Extremely Difficult**\n\nIn chapter 7, between pages 161 and 171, Duncan Watts talks heavily about us making predictions on complex adaptive systems. Generally, the more complex and large the systems are, the more difficult it is to predict the events that follow. This is especially the case when you, and all others have a massive degree of information asymmetry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuncan Watts stated the following about complex systems:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*In complex systems, however, which comprise most of our social and economic life, the best we can hope for is to reliably estimate the probabilities with which certain kinds of events will occur. Second, common sense also demands that we ignore the many uninteresting, unimportant predictions that we could be making all the time, and focus on those outcomes that actually matter. In reality ... black swan events that we most wish we could have predicted are not really events at all, but rather shorthand descriptions\u2014\u201cthe French Revolution,\u201d \u201cthe Internet,\u201d \u201cHurricane Katrina,\u201d \u201cthe global financial crisis\u201d\u2014of what are in reality whole swaths of history. Predicting black swans is therefore doubly hopeless, because until history has played out it\u2019s impossible even to know what the relevant terms are.*\n\nHe doesn't mean that everything in existence is unpredictable. He does say later that there's a fine line between predictable elements and unpredictable ones. He followed with a statement:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>To oversimplify somewhat, there are two kinds of events that arise in complex social systems\u2014***events that conform to some stable historical pattern, and events that do not*** ... Every year, for example, each of us may or may not be unlucky enough to catch the flu ... because seasonal influenza trends are relatively consistent from year to year, drug companies can do a reasonable job of anticipating how many flu shots they will need to ship to a given part of the world in a given month ... consumers with identical financial backgrounds may vary widely in their likelihood of *defaulting on a credit card, depending on what is going on in their lives ... credit card companies can do a surprisingly good job of predicting aggregate default rates by paying attention to a range of socioeconomic, demographic, and behavioral variables*. And *Internet* ***companies are increasingly taking advantage of the mountains of Web-browsing data generated by their users to predict the probability that a given user will click on a given search result***.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrediction markets don't distinguish what's reasonably predictable or what's not. The larger and more abstract the event, the more likely it is we won't be able to interpret a solid prediction of what's real or not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. Prediction Markets Provide Little Gain Compared to Statistical Studies**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe prospect of prediction markets are very nice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInside of that same chapter, Watts put some focus on prediction markets. Starting with the introduction of the idea.\n\n>One increasingly popular method is to use what is called a prediction market\u2014meaning a market in which buyers and sellers can trade specially designed securities whose prices correspond to the predicted probability that a specific outcome will take place. - p 164\n\n&#x200B;\n\nContinuing with understanding why our sentiment of prediction markets is so high. I too get excited about the idea of them, and he stated the potential scenarios of how they would interact:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The potential of prediction markets to tap into collective wisdom has generated a tremendous amount of excitement among professional economists and policy makers alike. Imagine, for example, that a market had been set up to predict the possibility of a catastrophic failure in deep-water oil drilling in the Gulf prior to the BP disaster in April 2010. Possibly insiders like BP engineers could have participated in the market, effectively making public what they knew about the risks their firms were taking. Possibly then regulators would have had a more accurate assessment of those risks and been more inclined to crack down on the oil industry before a disaster took place. Possibly the disaster could have been averted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, he and many others have done studies in prediction markets to test if this can accurately happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWatts tested for the accuracy of markets compared to statistical mechanics:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*little attention has been paid to evaluating the relative performance of different methods, so nobody really knows for sure. To try to settle the matter, my colleagues at Yahoo! Research and I conducted a systematic comparison of several different prediction methods, where the predictions in question were the outcomes of NFL football games. To begin with, for each of the fourteen to sixteen games taking place each weekend over the course of the 2008 season, we conducted a poll in which we asked respondents to state the probability that the home team would win as well as their confidence in their prediction. We also collected similar data from the website Probability Sports, an online contest where participants can win cash prizes by predicting the outcomes of sporting events. Next, we compared the performance of these two polls with the Vegas sports betting market\u2014one of the oldest and most popular betting markets in the world\u2014as well as with another prediction market, TradeSports. And finally, we compared the prediction of both the markets and the polls against two simple statistical probability that home teams win\u2014which they do 58 percent of the time\u2014while the second model also factored in the recent win-loss records of the two teams in question. In this way, we set up a six-way comparison between different prediction methods\u2014two statistical models, two markets, and two polls.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***The results:***\n\n>*Given how different these methods were, what we found was surprising:* ***All of them performed about the same.*** *To be fair,* ***the two prediction markets performed a little better than the other methods***\\*, which is consistent with the theoretical argument above. But the very best performing method\u2014the Las Vegas Market\u2014**was only about 3 percentage points more accurate than the worst-performing method**, which was the model that always predicted the home team would win with 58 percent probability.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe's a reasonable scientist. When he crafted a result, he tested it to see if he was wrong using other data-sets. We generally call it ***falsification***. It's the process of testing a hypothesis for inaccuracies. Doing this in the social realm is very hard, yet also requires the same amount of rigor. He followed it with another set of studies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first talked to the prediction market researchers:\n\n>*When we first told some prediction market researchers about this result, their reaction was that it must reflect some special feature of football ... Football games, in other words, have a lot of randomness built into them\u2014arguably, in fact, that\u2019s what makes them exciting. In order to be persuaded, our colleagues insisted, we would have to find the same result in some other domain for which the signal-to-noise ratio might be considerably higher than it is in the specific case of football.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo they tested for baseball. This was their results for that.\n\n>*We compared the predictions of the Las Vegas sports betting markets over nearly twenty thousand Major League baseball games played from 1999 to 2006 with a simple statistical model based again on home-team advantage and the recent win-loss records of the two teams. This time,* ***the difference between the two was even smaller\u2014in fact, the performance of the market and the model were indistinguishable****. In spite of all the statistics and analysis, in other words, and in spite of the absence of meaningful salary caps in baseball and the resulting concentration of superstar players on teams like the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox, the outcomes of baseball games are even closer to random events than football games. - p170*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. Some People Want to See The World Burn**\n\nThis is the final reason. \n\nIn the Dark Knight, Alfred had a power speech directly to Bruce Wayne. He made the statement *\"some people just want to watch the world burn\".*  This is a problem generally faced with every game theoretical problem. It faces characters like the Joker in the Batman, Hisoka in Hunter X Hunter. The characters that just destroy for the fun of it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuncan Watts actually explored the concept. He states the following: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*... it exposed a potential vulnerability of the theory, which assumes that rational traders will not deliberately lose money. The problem is that if the goal of a participant is instead to manipulate perceptions of people outside the market (like the media) and if the amounts involved are relatively small (tens of thousands of dollars, say, compared with the tens of millions of dollars spent on TV advertising), then they may not care about losing money, in which case it\u2019s no longer clear what signal the market is sending.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrediction markets forget about the idea of reflexivity, and the desire just to destroy stuff. Ultimately there's no protections against this. Even if they were to find enough active participants, you would have to worry about somebody with $1-2 million dollars just to influence somebody's perceptions on small, yet significant ideas, it could wreck havoc on people using such markets to plan. Especially if those plans are leveraged. It's a problem of opportunity cost. Generally, if I earn more for destroying your system from another, even if I earn indirectly, I'll just do it because why not?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's essentially the same problem behind market manipulation. People would be fine destroying the market if they get some indirect benefit from it. George Soros did it when he broke the Bank of England, some unknown figures did it when they tanked the market below $6000. It's easy. There's no defense mechanism against it in international markets, where anybody with a computer can tap in and blow things up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI recall seeing a recent article by somebody on this subreddit. He was putting together a solution to reduce the uncooperative games people may want to play and convert them into cooperative games using staking as a means to limit options. It works to an extent, but it runs the problem of destructive tendencies and opportunity cost. It also requires identity, which I doubt people will subscribe to if they don't have to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**That's it**\n\nSo that concludes why I reason prediction markets wont work. It's mostly an analysis. I infer, that just because you can't use them in one way, doesn't mean you can use them in others. I would say that it's unreasonable to believe that's the case. The predictions are just too big in range and not heavily well defined.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, if I get feedback to this I'll post on other topics like . \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sources and Bits of Information:**\n\n1. Ian Ayres (author of Supercrunchers ) calls the relative performance of prediction markets \u201cone of the great unresolved questions of predictive analytics\u201d ( [http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/23/prediction-markets-vs-super-crunching-which-can-better-predict-how-justice-kennedy-will-vote/](http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/23/prediction-markets-vs-super-crunching-which-can-better-predict-how-justice-kennedy-will-vote/) ). \n2. To be precise, we had different amounts of data for each of the methods\u2014for example, our own polls were conducted over only the 2008\u20132009 season, whereas we had nearly thirty years of Vegas data, and TradeSports predictions ended in November 2008, when it was shut down\u2014so we couldn\u2019t compare all six methods over any given time interval. Nevertheless, for any given interval, we were always able to compare multiple methods. See Goel, Reeves, et al.

I've posted a couple times in the past and still learning but trying to help the Monero community in any way possible.  I'm the guy who runs a cryptocurrency ATM company that also offers XMR in addition to the generic BTC, LTC, ETH choices.  There are 2,919 ATMs in the United States today, and of them, only 29 offer XMR.  I'm trying to double that number in the coming six months. :)  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh yea, we launched another one yesterday. So if you are in Massachusetts, you can buy Monero in person.  See: [https://coinmover.com/new-atm-town-convenience-stoneham/](https://coinmover.com/new-atm-town-convenience-stoneham/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway.  On my back end I have a bunch of servers. Lots of them for various stuff. One is a fully dedicated VPS just for the Monero daemon/RPC/wallet that only the ATM servers use to send and receive XMR.  I've noticed my node has fallen behind in syncing twice in the past two weeks.  I also noticed this line in a log file earlier when I rebooted my Monero server.  Can anyone help with some directed questions so perhaps I can keep this all running smoothly? (It is a VPS dedicated to running Monero daemon and RPC/wallet only).  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Note the first INFO line in the attached Pastebin log.  [**https://pastebin.com/PaJM91xx**](https://pastebin.com/PaJM91xx)  \\-- is that anything to worry about, subaddresses instead of encrypted payment IDs?  Do I have control over that?  I'm running the latest Monero 'Boron Butterfly' (v0.14.0.2-release).  \n2. My node has fallen behind twice.  Once onf 4/17 and once today on 4/22.  Look at lines 59-62 and lines 158-167 (before I rebooted earlier).  [**https://pastebin.com/xwXMpkjy**](https://pastebin.com/xwXMpkjy)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor either of these, does anyone notice something wrong/different?  I reboot the server and everything is fine.  I feel like something is not configured correctly, and could use some pointers.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been an I.T. guy for a long time and have 100 moving parts getting this all up and running and working (the entire end-to-end crypto ATM company), and hate asking open ended generic questions, but I just wanted to throw this out there and see if anything looks wrong.  I haven't had any complaints, then again XMR buys only account for a small fraction of my BTC business -- and XMR sells aren't enabled yet because nobody had added it to the source code from the vendor.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS.

As a side effect, this document provides guidance when evaluating the addition of a new moderator or the re-evaluation of an existing moderator.\n\nThis document also covers the role of /r/ethereum as a public forum, as well as the roles, responsibilities, and expectations of /r/ethereum participants.\n\n# Perception & Expectations of Moderators\n\nRegardless of how moderators view themselves, many people who visit or contribute to /r/ethereum view being a moderator as a privilege, not a right, burden, nor chore. Many see the moderators as being in a trusted position which lends credibility to their statements and gives them influence. Thus, many expect moderators to reflect and represent this community, the larger Ethereum ecosystem, and the values of Ethereum. Furthermore, many expect the moderators to be dedicated to Ethereum, and to keep Ethereum\u2019s long-term growth and goals top-of-mind.\n\nModerators should be mindful that their public words have the ability and power to shape, control, and influence the discussions. Their statements have the potential to be extremely valuable and impactful.\n\nFor these reasons, moderators should be mindful about how their commentary *could be perceived* by the diverse set of people who make up the Ethereum community. While moderating, participating in discussions on /r/ethereum, and even while participating in external discussion (e.g. on Twitter, on other forums, at conferences, etc.), they should aim to be transparent, communicate clearly, be explicit about their intentions, provide necessary context, and act in good faith.\n\nWhile some existing moderators or potential moderators may see this as unnecessarily limiting or burdensome, they should understand that many in the community strongly desire and encourage moderators to be active in discussions, to engage with the community, to share their viewpoints, to participate in open debate, to promote and help shape the goals and culture of the subreddit, and, most of all, to lead by example. Being mindful does not mean one must censor themselves or avoid disagreements. It simply means that one should ensure the tone and content of their commentary is ultimately constructive, not destructive.\n\nIf, after reading the above, a moderator cannot agree to be responsible and mindful in both their /r/ethereum participation and external discussion, they should be willing to excuse themselves from that role.\n\n# Expectations of Participants\n\nIn turn, participants on /r/ethereum and people around the Ethereum ecosystem should be mindful that no one is perfect, not even /r/ethereum moderators \ud83d\ude09. Living up to the aforementioned expectations is no small undertaking. While moderators try to do their best to meet the defined expectations, contributors are asked to practice patience and civility if and when they feel a moderator is not upholding their duties to the best of their ability.\n\nAs a first approach, people are encouraged to assume good-faith and respectfully open a dialog with the moderator, preferably in a public reply to the post or comment that is particularly concerning. A good way to start this dialog is by asking for clarification to ensure the participant clearly understands what the moderator *meant*. This ensures both parties are on the same page and provides an opportunity for clarification.\n\nIf the dialog is not fruitful and a person still strongly believes a moderator is not upholding their duties. Please avoid personal insults, brigading, ad hominems, inciting a mob-like mentality, overly emotional commentary, or sharing private conversations or information without the other party\u2019s consent. By being objective and setting a tone that encourages open-minded discussion, the conversation can be productive rather than polarizing, and, thus, is more likely to lead to a positive result for the community as a whole. If there is clear identification of a breach of mod roles and responsibilities, we would invite a message to the mod group to evaluate the situation and moderator in question. If there is no response on the matter from the moderators within 10 days, than a post on the topic would be appropriate.\n\nThe action that is taken after this discussion, if any, is reliant on the amount and type of input from the community and fellow moderators and handled on a case-by-case basis. This ensures each case is approached in proper context and not prior to the presently-unknown future circumstances. Ideally, if there is a large calling for a moderator to be removed, the moderator in question will voluntarily step down. Doing so should not be interpreted as the moderator agreeing with or admitting fault to the claims presented, but simply that the moderator is willing to sacrifice their position in order to avoid further conflict and distraction.\n\nAdditional details can be found in the \u201cEvaluating a Moderator\u201d section below. Lastly, please limit discussions to a single thread so the commentary can be more easily followed.\n\n# Role of /r/ethereum in the ecosystem\n\nThis subreddit is a trusted source of information, news, announcements, and discussions regarding (almost) everything Ethereum. It is often the go-to place for the latest information and a place newcomers arrive at looking for information and help as they get started. Posts and discussions and answers to questions often show up at the top of search results. It is also currently the most widely-used forum dedicated to longer-form discussion regarding Ethereum, though some argue it is not necessarily \u201cthe best\u201d forum.\n\nSome people who were previously active participants on /r/ethereum that are no longer active participants have cited lower quality content, lower quality discussions, unproductive arguments, trollish behavior, or personal attacks as the reason for becoming inactive. Regardless of the truthfulness of those reasons, they are the feelings and perceptions of some of those who left and should not be invalidated.\n\nFurthermore, many people cite the inclusiveness and welcoming nature of the community as their reason for focusing their time and efforts on Ethereum. Some note how turned off by the maximalism they experienced in other online communities, and didn\u2019t dive deeply into the blockchain space until they found Ethereum.\n\nFor the above reasons it is vital that this community is preserved in order to onboard the next generation of Ethereum builders and contributors *and* keep the existing builders and contributors. This subreddit and the larger community should encourage newcomers and existing members alike to participate.\n\nThis **does not** mean that everyone should always be in agreement. Diversity of ideas is more valuable than agreement. As Ethereum grows, the attitudes, goals, and views of community members become more diverse. This is a positive, even with the accompanying growing pains. Debate, competition, and disagreements are necessary to push things forward and evolve. It is incredibly valuable, so long as the disagreements do not devolve and have a negative effect on the ecosystem.\n\n## /r/ethereum aims to be a place...\n\n* ...for the open and good-faith discussion about the Ethereum blockchain, decentralized applications, governance, and related technologies.\n* ...that is not in perfect agreement all the time.\n* ...that values transparency, respect, decentralization, inclusivity, diversity.\n* ...made up of unique people with different backgrounds and worldviews.\n* ...filled with healthy, critical thinking.\n* ...to help advance the goals of Ethereum.\n* ...that consistently practices respect and empathy.\n* ...that is inclusive and encouraging of all types of people with all types of experiences.\n* ...that is welcoming, helpful, and patient with newcomers.\n* ...that aids in increasing the adoption of Ethereum.\n* ...to engage in civil discourse, controversial debates, and open discussions about problems.\n* ...void of hate, vitriol, insults, slurs, threats of violence, witch hunts. ...that encourages healthy debate and critical discussions surrounding Ethereum.\n\nEach day, we should strive to create and grow a welcoming, collaborative, productive environment that contributes and grows Ethereum as a whole\u2014one that helps progress Ethereum as a technology, as a set of loosely-shared values, a better version of the web, and as a community.\n\n# Roles & Responsibilities of Moderators\n\nFirst and foremost, the role of the moderators is to serve the Ethereum community. They should act in good faith and with Ethereum\u2019s best interest at heart as they make decisions and participate in discussions.\n\nIdeally, a moderator\u2019s decisions should be objective: remove posts that clearly violate the subreddit\u2019s listed rules and approve posts that do not violate the subreddits listed rules. Realistically, posts and rules require some amount of subjectivity.\n\nModerators should be thoughtful regarding the subjective decisions they make and strive for fairness, honesty, and transparency with themselves, their fellow moderators, and with the entire community.\n\nWhen removing a post or comment that is not obviously spam or a scam, the moderator should leave a note citing the rule that was violated. When removing posts, especially those with discussion, moderators should additionally \u2018distinguish & sticky\u2019 their comment. In most cases, a reply of, \u201cWe have removed your post for violating rule #2: Price discussion. Please keep price discussion to subreddits such as /r/ethtrader.\u201d is sufficient. For removals that may be controversial, more insight should be provided.\n\n## On a day-to-day basis, a moderators tasks include...\n\n* Approving posts that were incorrectly removed by the automoderator.\n* Removing posts that break the subreddit\u2019s stated rules.\n* Bringing any posts that require subjective decision-making or fall into a \u201cgray area\u201d in the rules to the attention of the moderation team for discussion.\n* Participating in discussions, especially those regarding moderation (both public posts on /r/ethereum or discussions in the internal moderator chat).\n* When necessary, starting and leading discussions regarding updating or adjusting the subreddit rules.\n* When necessary, attempting to improve the efficiency and success-rate of the automoderator. The automoderator is a very fickle beast.\n\n## Moderators should...\n\n* ...ensure discussions stay on-topic, civil, and productive.\n* ...lead by example.\n* ...be an active participant in the subreddit by promoting civil discourse, asking thoughtful questions, and encouraging people and projects.\n* ...be calm and polite, even when other participants are not.\n* ...offer helpful rule explanations, tips, and links to new or confused users.\n* ...keep a unified front when addressing users officially.\n* ...be open to the viewpoints of other moderators and participants and try to reach consensus on difficult items.\n\n## Moderators should not...\n\n* ...moderate posts based on personal ideologies.\n* ...distinguish comments or submissions when not speaking officially on behalf of /r/ethereum.\n* ...act unilaterally when making major revisions to rules, sidebars, or stylesheets.\n* ...take moderation positions in communities where their profession, employment, or biases could pose a direct conflict of interest to the neutral and user driven nature of reddit.\n* ...encourage or \"feed\" trolls.\n* ...ban users when they have not broken any rules.\n\n## Moderators should never...\n\nModerators should never moderate posts in which the moderator has a clear conflict of interest. This includes, but is not limited to, posts regarding: the moderator in question, the moderator\u2019s own company/product/project, or companies/products/projects in which the moderator is heavily emotionally or financially invested in.\n\n## Moderators should take extra care when...\n\nModerators should take extra care when moderating posts in which the moderator has a potential conflict of interest, and consider bringing the post to the attention of fellow moderators rather than moderating it themselves. This includes, but is not limited to, posts regarding a potential or perceived conflict of interest, posts by a contributor the moderator has had negative interactions with in the past, posts regarding a competitor to the moderator\u2019s company/product/project.\n\n## Moderators are not expected to\u2026.\n\nWhile moderators should endeavour to comply with the above roles and responsibilities, there are some items that are not expected of moderators.\n\n* Moderators do not need to be working full-time for Ethereum or Ethereum-related projects. Moderators are encouraged to have a life outside of /r/ethereum.\n* Moderators are not expected to disclose their financial investments or general financial state with anyone. Furthermore, moderators can invest in the assets they choose and even support non-Ethereum projects, provided the moderator does not act nor moderate against Ethereum or it\u2019s long-term interests.\n* Moderators do not need to hold viewpoints that are widely accepted by the community. Moderators may themselves promote civil debate on controversial items or hold contradictory ideas, so long as those are expressed within the rules of the /r/ethereum subreddit and are not clearly against Ethereum\u2019s long-term interests.\n* Moderators are not expected to produce a certain number of posts or comments. Moderators should be performing their duties and engaging with the community with at least a weekly cadence.\n\n## Evaluating a Mod\n\nIn response to the feedback received from members of the community and the reasons outlined in the \u201cPerception & Expectations of Moderators\u201d section above, the following items attempt to provide some guidelines for evaluating a moderator or calling for the removal of a moderator.\n\nEach case will be unique and this is not a comprehensive list. For example, a moderator may provide value in other ways not included in this list and that value should not be discredited or ignored when evaluating.\n\n* Do they support the Ethereum community?\n* Do they act in good faith and with Ethereum\u2019s best interests at heart?\n* Do they aim to ensure discussions stay on-topic, civil, productive?\n* Do they lead by example? (Some examples could include: promoting civil discourse, engaging in discussion, asking thoughtful questions, encouraging people and projects.)\n* Have they ever moderated a post in which there is a potential or perceived conflict of interest without first consulting other mods?\n* Have they ever moderated something based on personal ideologies?\n* Do they approve posts incorrectly removed by the automoderator?\n* Do they remove posts that break the subreddit rules?\n* Do they participate in discussions with other mods or the community? How often do they perform the aforementioned moderator duties? Daily? Weekly? Not for some time?\n* Have they ever started a discussion on the subreddit rules? Should they have?\n* Have they ever attempted to tame the wild beast that is the automoderator? Do they have the skills to do that? Should they have?\n* Are they transparent about their reasons for removing a post when asked?\n* Have they ever moderated posts in which they have a clear conflict of interest? Is their primary focus on Ethereum, or something else? (Day job, traditional world, banks, other blockchains, etc.) Does this have a real effect on their role in Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem or their responsibilities as a moderator of /r/ethereum?\n\n# Roles & Responsibilities of Participants\n\nEach person who contributes to /r/ethereum should aim to add value to the discussion and to the larger Ethereum community, in good faith, and as described above under \u201cRole of /r/ethereum in the ecosystem\u201d.\n\nEach person is responsible for what /r/ethereum is today and what it becomes tomorrow. Some tangible \u201cdo\u2019s\u201d and \u201cdo not\u2019s\u201d for participants are outlined below. However, the scope of these is quite limited compared to what is described in the \u201cRole of /r/ethereum in the ecosystem\u201d section above. Therefore, it is the responsibility of each participant to take their own life experiences, perceptions, skills, knowledge, opinions, and understanding to add value to /r/ethereum to the best of their ability.\n\n## Making the Best of /r/ethereum\n\n**Aim for positivity.** Discuss in good-faith and assume others are discussing in good-faith as well. Be welcoming, inclusive, and encouraging. Practice patience, respect, and empathy. Engage in healthy debate, civil discourse, and critical discussions. Focus on the post, not the poster, during disagreements.\n\n**Upvote and downvote things.** This built-in moderation tool is exceptionally powerful. Keep in mind, upvotes/downvotes are not for voicing agreement/disagreement. When a post or comment contributes or adds value, even if one personally disagrees, it should be upvoted. When a post or comment does not contribute, nor add value, or the post or comment is off-topic, downvote it.\n\n**Use the report button.** Posts or comments that violate the subreddit rules can, and should, be reported. This brings it to the moderator\u2019s attention more quickly. When reporting, please provide as much detail as possible to help moderators more quickly evaluate each item in the moderation queue. Lastly, please don\u2019t report posts or comments out of disagreement, only about things that actually break the rules.\n\n**Stay on topic.** Discussions about other cryptocurrencies and related technologies are welcome, but if the topic is already being extensively covered by other threads, it is kindly recommended to post it to a more specific subreddit. There is an extensive (but not comprehensive) list of Ethereum-related Subreddits on the [\"All Ethereum\" Multireddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/all_ethereum/m/all_ethereum/).\n\n## Follow the Subreddit Rules\n\n**No inappropriate behavior.** This includes, but is not limited to: personal insults, threats of violence, slurs of any kind, posting people's private information.\n\n**Avoid speculation, price, market, and mining discussions.** Discussion related to the price of ether, buying, trading, market speculation, or any other price/market talk should be posted on /r/ethtrader, a third-party Subreddit not moderated by us. In addition, keep mining discussion to subreddits such as /r/EtherMining.\n\n**No spamming, scamming, drive-by posting, duplicate posts, misleading titles, or blogspam.**\n\n* Don\u2019t spam a single blog, project, company, or ICO. Posts should come from a variety of sources, cover different topics, and the poster should engage in discussions on their posts.\n* Don\u2019t attempt to scam people, link to phishing websites, or promote malicious applications.\n* Don\u2019t be that person who runs into the community, dumps a link to something, and then disappears immediately.\n* Check [https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/new/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/new/) to avoid posting something that is already being discussed. Instead, add to the ongoing conversation.\n* Avoid titles that do not accurately reflect the content of the post or are written to stimulate clicks.\n* Avoid linking to sites that lightly rewrite content in order to drive traffic to their site and generate ad revenue.\n\n**No using multiple accounts. No posting from brand new accounts.** Creating multiple accounts to get around rules is not allowed and will likely result in a permanent ban. Additionally, posts should be made from accounts at least 10 days old with a minimum of 20 comment karma. This is to keep trolls and spam-bots to a minimum.

A full node is a peer. Running a node and using it to verify blocks is the only proper way of using it. Only by doing so can you ensure that you don't have to trust a third party. Running a node helps to prevent Bitcoin from being shut down.\n\nThere is another more sophisticated way to destroy Bitcoin. It's to hijack Bitcoin protocol by releasing modified malicious version of node software. By running your own node, you also help to stop such attacks.\n\nKeep in mind Bitcoin has been, is and will be under attack by various people because it brings monetary sovereignty to people, which bankers hate; it makes money transferring easy and cheap, which payment and remittance companies hate; it is the king of cryptocurrencies, which altcoiners hate.

", "The year was 2010... i was in my final year of school at st johns university, living in a small dorm with 2 guys. i would say march or april if i had to guess the month, early 2010 for sure. I was excessively told about bitcoin by my 2 of my college  roommates who spent too much time online and decided to do some of my own research, read the whitepaper made by satoshi n and was quite fascinated by the technology, i knew it was something new and ahead of the time, but also something that could terribly fail and be another fad. although, because of how much my 2 roomies talked about it i decided why not throw a bit of money into it, and was fine with losing it or not. so fast forward, i lived in new york and was able to find a local who actually sold bulks of bitcoin through my 2 friends who previously bought off them. i was a bored college student... didnt know what i was gonna end up doing with the coins. i wanted to buy $50 worth... ended up spending a bit more than that $60-$80 i believe to get exactly 10,000 bitcoins. it was given to me on a usb which was checked on his computer to verify the bitcoins were really there before i took off. everything was good and i transferred the file from the usb to my personal laptop. now, a single bitcoin was worth a fraction of a penny so i really did not have much focus on such a small thing (at the time). ever since i put it on my laptop i really just forgot about it and did not even think about any ways for me to spend it or use it etc. and just kept it stored on my laptop. i continued to forgot about it due to me graduating college being my primary focus and that's that. then after i graduated i looked to work and did work and never really even thought to care about some stupid bitcoin i bought off some guy for a bit of money. it was just another file on my computer i didnt bother to even look at for months on months.   \n\nNow fast forward to early 2014 --- this is when i first heard about bitcoin again since i bought em, and no i did not continue to hear from them from my two roommates i was with while in college as 2010 is the year i graduated and after that we did not keep in touch. although i would assume they either lost the bitcoin they had online or are rich as fuck right now, wont find out as i have no way to contact them. anyways, so i was hanging out with a friend of mine who mentioned it to me and how the price went to $1000 and was down a bit and it would be a good time to buy some because he thought it was the future of money, it took me a few minutes to process, then it hit me and i literally almost fainted after coming to the realization i was pretty sure i had a shit ton of what he was talking about. i didnt even fully remember whether i had 1,000, 10,000, 100,000 immediately because of how much it was and how long ago i bought it but i knew it was one of those. i was so shocked and he was so confused then i just left the conversation as soon as he told me about the price to go online and check for myself if this is really the same shit i bought 4 years ago as a curious college student. it all hit me at once, i knew by the symbol and the chart which showed it going from where i bought it at less than a penny all the way to over $1000 that this was exactly what i bought and i remembered i bought 10,000 with the $60-$80 i spent and was in disbelief and euphoria over the fact that i had an absolute huge fortune waiting for me at home. this all felt unreal to me, i still remember the emotions i had going through me. now after realizing i had this fortune, i had to remember carefully where i stored these bitcoins, eventually i remembered i had it on my old personal laptop and at that moment i had a panic attack due to the fact that the laptop i had put the bitcoin on broke on me and was replaced although i figured i am not totally doomed because all i should need to get the file is the hard drive. \n\nSo here I am at home, looking for the computer only to realize that because it was broken and old and damaged, my mom told me she had thrown it away a few years back after it broke down on me since she thought it was pretty much untouched junk and expected id never need it again. at that point i literally fainted, i was angry, confused, shocked, in denial, sad, raged and so many other emotions all at once that i literally just passed out. my mom woke me back up and i ran out of the house out of anger to go have a mental breakdown in my backyard. What was supposed to be the best day of my life become by far the worst. As u can imagine, the fact that i thought i had what was between 5-10 mil at the time and then right after had that taken away from me broke my heart. i never felt the amount of pain and severe depression i felt as i did on that day. the next few months of my life were spent very badly, every day i would be reminded of what happened and how my life could of been but wasnt because my mom threw out my fortune, i am not proud of it but i started to actually resent her and be disrespectful to her often. it was a bad bad time as i was working a shitty job with low pay and living in my parents house at 25 (shout out to my useless degree) so that bitcoin would have really changed my life completely. i started going through severe depression and suicidal thoughts constantly, i really did want to kill myself knowing what had happened to me. although i tried to get through it and didnt even tell any of my friends including the one who mentioned bitcoin to me to remind me of bitcoin what happened, though they felt i was acting different and not my usual self those following months. i barely went out, i lost my job due to my sudden lack of effort from what happened, i lost friends, i isolated myself from everyone and everything including my family. i gained a lot of weight and did a lot of dumb shit im not proud of. my life was pretty horrible for the year of 2014.  \n\n\nNow fast forward to early 2015 i started to get back on my feet and try to get over the shitty year i just had. and the fact bitcoin dipped to $200ish helped with how i felt about the whole thing, though i never even considered putting another penny in it again and hoped it would just crash and die so i could keep this in the past, although as u all know this wasnt the case. now here we are in 2019, i am still broke, i still live with my parents, i am employed, but at a shitty job i hate, and have friends, but we dont talk much, and life is just not the same as it used to be. Life just hasn\u2019t been the same since 2014. Seeing bitcoin go up insane amounts all the way to nearly 20k and now still thriving at around 5k really makes me sick to the stomach, to think that i bought 10,000 at less than a penny, WHAT THE FUCK... it still hurts. i really just want to feel like this is just some very long shitty ass nightmare and wake up to reality again but i know thats not the case. i could have had the most epic fucking life and most epic story to tell of how my riches came but it never happened. my life is on a downhill, i am severely depressed and just feel so shit everyday. things are not the same as they once were and never will be the same because bitcoin has ruined my life, or maybe i allowed it to ruin my life, idk. my hopes were all high and euphoric then right after low and dreadful within 24 hours, and it has impacted me til now and will continue to weigh me down for however much longer i live.  there is really no specific moral to this story, but i just wanted to vent this to someone or somewhere finally to get my story out. this is the first and last time i will speak out publicly to anyone about this, so there you guys go. that is the story of how i lost 10,000 bitcoin. that is all.\n\ntldr; college roommates convinced me to buy bitcoin back in 2010, i ended up buying 10,000 bitcoins for $60-80 and storing them on my laptop, forget about it until 2014 when my friend randomly mentions it hitting $1k and a good buying opportunity, i rush home to look for my old broken laptop which had the bitcoins on it in the hard drive to discover my mom threw it out and the bitcoins were gone forever, i become severely depressed and affected by this and til this day cant help but think what if i had those bitcoins. life sucks, fuck bitcoin, the end.", "Things Ive read from smart Oilers twitter in 24 hours. \nAngry at 97 because hes too dumb to request trade.\n97 i https://t.co/sZEPbCSUFJ", "Governments, especially totalitarian ones, hate competition. \n\n#cryptocurrency #cryptonews #bitcoin #mining https://t.co/GuQkj1bpKa", "RT @CoinCapsAi: #tron #'partners' with #local #police against #angry #mob at #beijing #office \n#cryptocurrency #airdrop #xrp #trading #Free", "Coindelta abandons its users by levying high withdrawal fees; users express their displeasure and retaliate https://t.co/EJikAGTVj2", "This sucks because the roi of vet is already pretty low.

Hoping someone could break it down for me.  Started off with BTC, converted it to BCH via a 3rd party service that is offered via [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com).  [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com) does not offer the same service for brokers, they provide a link to brokers, many of which appear not to work (at least for USD).\n\nI think I understand how to set up an account at a broker, sell my BCH through them, and then deposit to my bank account.  Can anyone suggest a brokerage?  I am not overly concerned with paying fees at this point, within reason.\n\nCan I use the BCH in my wallet at a Bitcoin ATM?  There are a couple less than 5 miles from me, but having never used one, I am not sure how they work.\n\nAny help is appreciated.  FYI, a friend of mine owed me a few thousand dollars that I loaned him a couple of years ago when he was going through a divorce and had lost his job.  I never expected that he would pay it back since his financial situation was fairly grim.  He apparently got a small amount of money from another friend and invested in Bitcoin and has made a decent amount of money...so he contacted me and asked if he could pay me back with Bitcoin since it would be easier for him (he lives in Europe now).  So I set up a [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com) wallet and he transferred the BTC to me, made no mention that I'd have to convert it to BCH, then sell via a broker.  I've asked him for help but I think he thinks I'm mad at him since I mentioned that all of this was inconvenient and it would have been easier if he had sent me the money via Paypal or something like that.  He did pay back more than the original loan, so again, I am not too concerned with fees, I'd just like an easy way to convert this to cash.

I don\u2019t know you. We are complete strangers, so the words that I\u2019m about to type may not ring true to some, but maybe a few.\n\nIt feels bad. It feels like shit. There is no denying that. The price of XRP being so stagnant does hit hard. You, me, and everyone else that own this coin are in it for the money. That is the end goal. There is nothing to be ashamed about this, as we all want to gain wealth in this darned economy. So when the price isn\u2019t moving, and things aren\u2019t going the way we expect them, we get frustrated. This is normal. \n\nI understand that some want to hide this frustration, to appear strong. And I mean this is the internet, what better place to do it?\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to get at is that let these feelings go over you. In your real life, in your mind, do not ignore these thoughts, these feelings. Don\u2019t try to bury them deep. That\u2019s not healthy. Instead, acknowledge them. When they come, look at these emotions and feel them. They\u2019re not here forever, it\u2019ll pass.\n\nMany people say that investing and emotions do not mix. This is very true. In this current state, there\u2019s a very real risk that you might be thinking of jumping ship. And that\u2019s fine, honestly. But only after you\u2019ve analyzed the situation, looked at the different outcomes. These outcomes will be different for everyone, but it\u2019s still necessary to think about them.\n\nWhat good does it do me to hold a coin, any coin, and hope that it makes money, only for it to stay stagnant. You might think \u201cdoesn\u2019t do me any good at all\u201d. But if you\u2019re thinking this at the heat of the moment, when looking at charts and reading threads, and then you *act* on these emotions and turn them into actions, then you are, my friend, being manipulated (to a certain extent).\n\nSo, yes. Look at the charts. Read the threads. Get angry, or frustrated. But do not act at that moment. That is you letting your emotions take control of your actions.\n\nInstead, after getting frustrated, sit back, and tell yourself that you\u2019ll get back to this when you have more time. Do your duties of the day and once you get back home, sit down for a couple of minutes and analyze the situation from a perspective that is void of erratic emotions. \n\nOnly then should you carry out an act, wether that be to hold, sell, etc.\n\nSorry for the long read, but I felt that this was necessary to say. I see many people getting antsy on here (now imagine what all the lurkers are thinking about!). Hopefully this post will remind some that taking a moment to rationalize a situation (any situation) will usually be beneficial to you.\n\nTo end this, I want to say that I\u2019ve been a lurker on this thread for quite some time. I love it. It has its ups and downs, but compared to other crypto threads I honestly feel like we\u2019ve got a neat, close community here. And posting about your fears and such on here shouldn\u2019t be downvoted. While many may think that they\u2019re trying to spread FUD, you never know a persons full situation, let alone on the internet. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty out there worried about the current events surrounding us, but honestly, let\u2019s take a step back and look at the big picture.\n\nFeels better, doesn\u2019t it? Zooming out let\u2019s us see the end goal. And while some may call that a far fetched way of dreaming, it\u2019s the dreams and goals of people that change the things around us.

Especially considering the fact that the two projects have almost similar life-length.\n\nLet me make it clear, ADA is 99.5% of my portfolio, and i'm in since November of 2018, but let's be honest, there are questions to be raised, and I would start with: how about getting Staking released after 5 official postponements?\n\nHere's the comment:\n\n Some facts about Cardano: - They have a wallet. Its not working very well, takes forever to sync.  But, its peer reviewed....like everything else will be. - still running on one server, but promisses to be the most  decentralized of all. Some day... - The IOHK contract expires in 2020. - One of the only two dapps that were developing on cardano (sp8do)  moved to eos.  - Did i mention that they have a wallet?    \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome facts about eos: - running with NO FEES and INSTANT transactions (try gaming  sites...youll be amazed) on 21 Block Producers out of 500+ from which  the voters can choose from, every 2 minutes. - VC founds investing 100s of millions (Novogratz Galaxy digital 325  Million, $100m FinLab AG and BlockOne VC Fund, $50m SVK Crypto and B1  fund, $50m Tomorrow Blockchain opportunities fund, ...\\_\\_\\_).  - $1bn BlockOne commitment to fund Dapps in the Eco system (EOS VC  Initiative)  - $200m VC fund with Blockchain veterans Michael Cao and Winnie Liu,  which will make strategic investments in Asia-focused projects utilizing  EOSIO  - Bitmain's Jihan Wu investing heavy in BlockOne  - PayPal\u2019s Peter Thiel investing heavy in BlockOne  - Rob Jesudason, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Australia\u2019s  Commonwealth Bank (CBA), has left the bank to join BlockOne as chief  operating officer  - Tomorrow Ventures, a venture capital linked to former Alphabet Inc  chairman Eric Schmidt, is also involved.  - sister chains launching (Worbly, Telos, Eosforce, Boid, Evolution,  Eoseurope, BOS,..) They will eventually have inter-Blockchain  communication (IBC) which will be a revolution in speed and usability.  - Activision (call of duty, angry birds) and Mythical games giants  already building on eos. Mythical Games $16m founded by VC's.  - China government rated EOS number 1 crypto many times.  - Weiss Rating rated EOS number 1 crypto  - blocktivity shows - 87 million trx per day, more than all other crypto  combined and multiplied many times - in its inphancy (In comparison  Ethereum average 600k and Bitcoin average 500k)  - 17.000 trx pre pecond on testnet, beating every other project many  times over  - Wickipedia founder launched Everypedia on EOS, growing fast and  thinking on launching their own eos sister chain - DappRadar - most used dapps of all other crypto  - Second in number of developers, behind ethereum (not for long as they  are moving to eos) - free Airdrops and Airgrabs, worth 1/3 of the EOStokens in just 8  months and coming more and more frequent  - Bancor launched a decentralised exchange where you can trade ETH,  ERC20, EOS and all EOS airdrops directly beetween them, without fees  - many DEX exchanges where you can trade EOS airdrops directly from/to  your EOS account - no need to send them anywhere!! (jeah, really!) Eos  is growing a brand new internal blockchain market of its own. Many  tokens atm are only tradable in EOS.  - introducing EOSBTC, EOSETH and EOSUSDT..that act like eth, btc and  usdt stable coins, but on eos's blockchain speed  - Ledger Nano S integration, where you can set up Ledger to be your  active or owner key... and so protecting your eos account even if  someone steals your Ledger. A revolution in crypto security.  - 4,8 BILLION US DOLLARS warchest in CASH  - EOS's development funding is the only crypto that is not effected by  the bear market - BlockOne is the only one out there hireing lots of  developers in a bear market when others are laying them off.  - Many Dapps migrating from ETH to EOS (Sense coin, havven, texico,  medipedia, sentinel, Eos Dice bet,...). Even one of the only two dapps  developing on cardano just moved to eos (sp8do), publicly exposing  cardano as too complicated to build on.  - incredibly scalable (every future issue can be fixed easily without a  fork) - FORTH crypto in trading volume in a BEAR market (only behind BTC, ETH  and USDT)  - multiple exchanges adding EOS trading pairs regularly  - Blockchain with human readable names, makes transferes as easy as  possible  - Blockchain with top security, the first one with the so called 'owner'  and 'active' key pairs.  - one of the strongest and largest community there is. EOS reddit, EOS  telegram, a huge amount of sub communities too like for Block Producers,  Developers, Designers, people who just talk price action... Even the  individual block producers have their own communities, sister chains  have their own, dapps build on eos have their own communities... - Virginia Tech - the tech school where Dan Larimer is teaching young  troops on eos and blockchain...wait till they come out of there... - Chintai lending, where you can lent your eos resources for profit,  today.  - Huobi just launched a new exclusively EOS based exchange, where voting  and other things will be possible.  - referendum voting is on, the ultimate decentralisation. Power to the  token hodlers. - EVA, the Uber competition dapp built on EOS got an official operating  permit in Quebec  - Just out - support for Microsofts .

That you can send from eos account to  another eos account without a trace... ;) - Tapatalk, a forum system that has over 200.000 forums all around the  internet, and more that 300 mio users, is implementing their reward  system on EOS. - EffectAI (EFX) moving from NEO to EOS in april 19. - Sense, the new telegram on eos, launched. - Wanchain announced it will integrate with EOS. - FCAS standars of CoinMarketCap rates EOS in first place. - Block one released an hardware wallet as an open source library so any  HW can use it - cybersecurity veteran Eddie Schwartz joins Block1 as chief information  security officer - EOS is listed on CoinBase Pro. -   Still to come (and consequently rise the price):  - REX renting (voting incentive, CPU congestion solving)  - Block One wallet (with all the goodies in one secure place)  - Trezor and other hard wallets implementation  - banking on eos (yes, they are opening their own bank where the  costumers will be the owners, it is called The Good Bank)  - dmail - an email beetween eos accounts, just about finished - facebook on eos,  - identitiy on eos,  - genome on eos  - financial markets on eos,  - last but not least - Dan Larimer thinking of a Bitcoin on stereoids on  the eos chain (so called Shower coin, that made the competition shit in  their pants according to the \"Dan is leaving\" FUD they are still  desperately trying to spread)  All this in under a year...
