Anyway the minimum deposit was 50 dollars and i was not impressed because i was looking to deposit half of that.\n\nI was up in the morning with a text from a \"customer representative\" from aionmarkets which contacted me through whatsapp. I thought he was being just friendly at first but i soon realised he was trying to get me to start an investment plan. He says 500 dollars if i invested i would be making 5% daily profit guarenteed. (25$ a day). And there is better profit percentages more you deposit. I told him i was a broke ass student and can't just get 500 together like that. He kept asking me how much i had i say 20 dollars, he says deposit it which i do and i see tge balance change on the website later.\n\nHe made me a ridiculous offer like i can give you 300 if you can sort the rest and pay me from the profits which i soon disagreed with. I try to withdraw my money using the options on the website and it tells me at end step that i need to invest in a plan before i can get my own money.

The [thread it was posted in](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/baz1o5/ethdao_making_ethereum_great_again_aragon/) seems unpopular (for good reason, as I'll try to show), so I've created a separate top-level thread to air out these thoughts for added visibility and also to encourage a bit more discussion.\n\nYes, my tone can be construed as hostile. I find this company deeply offensive to my sensibilities and I don't apologize.\n\n>\"At Aragon One, we care a great deal about our users\"\n\nI have yet to see evidence of that. I think you mean you care about your \"stakeholders\".\n\n>\"Even if we love Ethereum and it was the community that we originated from, we are also looking into Polkadot\"\n\nIn other words, you think it makes sense to join forces with a private permissioned version of the Ethereum ecosystem to hedge your bets against the community that funded your project and made you all filthy rich. That's some fantastic loyalty and integrity right there. What could possibly go wrong by trying to get rich a second time by betraying your base?\n\nAragon's Polkadot play won't actually make \"decentralized organizations widespread\". That's just more inauthentic messaging. Parity's Web3 umbrella will be controlled by a very narrow group of stakeholders with DOT tokens (basically, Gavin Wood and his backers). That renders all inter-blockchain communication dependent on a plutocratic oligarchy. Public blockchains will become increasing centralized through this mechanism as more people use the underlying root chain for coordination. Organizations based on this kind of infrastructure will become vulnerable to all manner of meddling and disruption by the all-powerful DOT-holders. That's not the kind of infrastructure the public will have any legitimate reason to support. Thus, the organizations built atop this infrastructure will never become widespread.\n\n>\"CEO at Aragon One\"\n\nNeed I say more? This is literally an oxymoron.\n\n>\"I am writing this because I deeply care about Ethereum. Also because Aragon holds \\~0.25% of all ETH. I also hold ETH personally. So I\u2019d love for Ethereum to work out #tribalism\"\n\nI have yet to see evidence of that. I think you mean you \"deeply care\" about the riches that were carelessly dropped into your coffers. Also, having a sense of community or loyalty to a cause isn't \"tribalism\". It would be great if you and others stopped abusing this derogatory term to rationalize your own infidelities.\n\n>\"It\u2019s clear that developers are the end user of Ethereum\".\n\nIt's not \"clear\" at all. It's actually false. Developers take advantage of Ethereum in order to reach the end users. It's not complicated. If we expect Ethereum to amount to more than a shallow private club for coders then it needs to serve the interests of the wider public. If you expect any kind of adoption of this technology, then you must target the users first and foremost. The developers are the means to that end. So, you've got it entirely backwards.\n\n>\"the users wouldn\u2019t even notice they are using Ethereum\"\n\nThat's the very same line of thought that led people to start using Facebook and other walled gardens. Fooling people with a friendly and convenient UX doesn't legitimize your underlying tech stack, end-user license agreement, and so on. Enough with these deceptive practices.\n\n>\"The original plan (as heard from Ethereum cofounders) was to migrate the Ethereum Foundation funds into a DAO once the technology was ready. Now it is ready, so I propose that it\u2019s time to do so.\"\n\nThe original plan never identified the governance structure of this DAO. The reason it hasn't happened to this point isn't because of a lack of desire, but because the technology, and the community itself (by which I mean everyone with an interest in Ethereum, not just devs!), are still too immature and inexperienced to produce a viable and legitimate system.\n\nClaiming the Ethereum community is suddenly ready because Aragon has played around with a few corporate toy models is a joke of epic proportions, honestly. Aragon might know how to hack a few things together, but I highly doubt they understand good governance. Good governance in a \"public organization\" context isn't a product. It's a philosophy; or principle-based ideology for decision-making. The technology merely tries to embody this underlying logic. If you have a bad philosophy, you'll end up with bad governance and bad technology. Aragon has a terrible philosophy. In my opinion, it's selfish, corporate capitalism gone wild. Ergo, their approach to governance and technology will be similarly terrible. They admit as much when they say:\n\n>\"we certainly don\u2019t know what\u2019s the best governance mechanism for something like Ethereum\"\n\nAnd yet, they go on to attack the current informal governance process, proposing a \"committee system\" in its place. What's this committee system, you ask? Good question! Supposedly, it'll just be \"how it works today in a transparent manner\". Bullshit, I'm sorry. What Aragon has in mind here is formalized coin voting and little else. They haven't developed any real software to account for people's legitimate reasoning and democratic concerns, which is the only thing saving the current governance process from complete failure and tyranny!\n\nTo be very clear, our ability to voice our concerns and to actually be heard by the community at large, regardless of our perceived \"stake\" and \"status\", is what makes Ethereum governance different from other networks. It's the one saving grace keeping us in a somewhat respectable state. Sacrificing that democratic hope so that the entrenched inner circle of early adopters (the \"stakeholders\") can rule us more effectively is one of the most horrifying mistakes I can imagine.\n\nTLDR; Aragon is a deceptive untrustworthy corporate entity. They're merely using this EthDAO proposal to market their own broken philosophy and broken technology to the rest of us.", "RT @Ownism: Onederx | Cryptocurrency Derivatives Exchange\n\nEarn on the rising and falling Bitcoin with high leverages, low commissions, and", "It's so sad he has to fight to prove what everyone knows to be the truth.

Regardless of whether or not lessons have been learned in capital protection during this bear or one simply researches enough to become confident and then \"sets it and forgets it\" (aka buys & holds and perhaps still follows news/developments closely) - the folks who understands that that there are indeed cycles realize that the sky is not falling and responsible projects with legit long-term vision and plans well underway like **VeChain** (and new opportunities in the form of backed entities such as **Plair** & **Safe Haven)** can be invested in and accumulated at a bargain right now. \n\nThis is in no way shape or form any kind of financial advice.

I don't see what it can do except ignore broadcasts from that node.\n* If the above is true, then what prevents a malicious node operator from just creating a new node and going back to \"zero\" reputation?\n* What if a malicious actor decides to buy a node that has a good reputation? What incentive does the node operator have to not sell it and just make a new one?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Stars\n\nAs for **stars**, I assume that it would be up to each node to pick its stars. \\_Otherwise, if stars are enforced, the network would essentially be as strong as those star nodes alone, with other nodes just being bystanders.\\_ Even with that, I am not convinced that stars are the right way forward.\n\n* What prevents the main stars from being controlled by governments to reject/accept some transactions?\n* In what way is the stars method better then the node accountability method? It just sounds like a manual version of node accountability to me.\n* How does the average person become a star without being famous or acting on behalf of a big company/government?

This impulsive move to the upside represents, once again, a support/resistance flip (outlined in blue). This level previously supplied resistance as the market found itself unable to maintain support every time the market made its way to the top half of the range.This shakeout into a support/resistance flip is often symptomatic of reaccumulation in the market. Failure to maintain this support would obviously change the market structure, but so long as the hourly time frame maintains its support on this level, the market structure remains bullish. And, considering it\u2019s consolidating right below the red resistance outlined in Figure 1, it puts the bears in an uneasy position.The fact that we haven\u2019t been completely rejected at this level yet, after our fourth attempt to crack the resistance, is a good sign that supply is exhausting and bears are running out of ammo for the time being. Also, it should be noted that this red level we are testing is a level that could soon put shorters underwater on their positions. If we see a strong test to the upside and manage to push a new high, it is very likely we will see a strong continuation in the upward direction.For months, the market has stacked short position after short position in a very tight band of prices. If we shove above that band of prices we can expect to see a strong surge of stop losses hit the market in what\u2019s known as a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d A short squeeze is essentially just a cascade of stop losses that close out short positions via a market buy order. As the price pushes further up, the stop losses continue to stop out the next person in line, then the next person in line, and so on, until the bears are finally cleared out of their positions.This short squeeze idea is all speculation at this point as we have yet to manage to find support on the red band of resistance described in this article \u2014 it\u2019s just something to consider as the shorters begin to pile up, yet again, for the fourth time.Summary:Creeping upward, the market finally finds itself testing long-held overhead resistance. So far, we have seen three unsuccessful tests that were swiftly rejected. And now, for the fourth time, the market finds itself testing the level without a strong rejection.The market has managed to find support on macro levels that were previously resistant for the first time as we creep up once again for a test of the macro resistance.On lower time frames, we can see signs of reaccumulation as bitcoin grinds against the macro resistance and tests the strength of the supply in the market.Trading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Gox is stepping down amid what he described as a protracted legal quagmire that could take years to resolve completely.\n\nAndy Pag, the founder and coordinator of Mt. Gox Legal, told CoinDesk in an exclusive interview this week that he now believes ongoing legal issues \u2013 in particular, a single massive claim by startup incubator and former Mt. Gox partner Coinlab \u2013 may hold up the crypto exchange\u2019s civil rehabilitation process for up to two more years.\n\nPag, who started Mt. Gox Legal roughly 18 months ago with the intent to advocate for the reimbursement of creditors, first revealed his opinion of the expected timeline in a private forum post last week, obtained by CoinDesk, which told creditors he would be stepping down from his role as coordinator at the end of the month.\n\nThe viewpoint put forth in the letter (attached in full below) conflicts with more optimistic assessments that creditors may be paid before the end of 2019.\n\nMt. Gox, at one point the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, went into bankruptcy in 2014 shortly after its operators discovered that some 850,000 bitcoins had been stolen from its wallets. While some of these funds were later recovered, the exchange never did.\n\nHowever, partly due to the massive increase in price between 2014 and 2017, Mt Gox went from a bankruptcy proceeding to a civil rehabilitation process that remains ongoing.\n\nThat this occurred is significant: under bankruptcy proceedings, the exchange\u2019s customers would receive the fiat equivalent to their holdings at the time Mt Gox entered bankruptcy. Under civil rehabilitation, the customers will actually receive the amount they lost in bitcoin instead.\n\nWhen the Tokyo District Court, which is overseeing the case, first announced that Mt Gox would enter civil rehabilitation last June, claimants expected that they may receive their missing bitcoin as soon as this year. The claim by Coinlab, however, has since putting this timeline in jeopardy.\n\nNow it appears to be impacting other efforts by creditors to self-organize to achieve reimbursement.\nLegal slugfest\n\nCoinlab, which has been backed by Tim Draper, Barry Silbert and Roger Ver (among others), entered into a partnership with Mt. Gox in 2012 to essentially act as the exchange\u2019s U.S. branch. However, Coinlab sued Mt Gox in 2013 alleging that the exchange had failed to honor the agreement and asking for $75 million.\n\nMt. Gox then counter-sued, claiming it was Coinlab who breached their agreement. Neither case was resolved prior to Mt. Gox\u2019s bankruptcy filing, though Coinlab did stake a claim against the exchange at the time of the filing.\n\n\u201cCoinlab originally put in a bankruptcy claim originally of $75 million which people thought was excessive \u2026 When we went to civil rehabilitation, everyone refiled the same claim, but Coinlab filed $16 billion,\u201d Pag explained.\n\nEdgar Sargent, a U.S. based attorney for Coinlab, told CoinDesk that he could not speak to the amount filed in Japan, and was not familiar enough with Japanese law or court proceedings to discuss the matter. Coinlab\u2019s Japanese attorneys could not be reached for comment. Coinlab founder Peter Vessenes did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe first problem stems from the fact that the Mt Gox trustee, Nobuaki Kobayashi, normally attributes voting rights to creditors based on the size of their stake. This cannot happen with Coinlab until the claim is assessed.\n\nPag explained:\n\n    \u201cBecause it\u2019s pending and it\u2019s still disputed, the trustee can\u2019t attribute fair voting rights if it\u2019s accepted or zero voting rights if it\u2019s rejected but \u2026 until it\u2019s [resolved] the trustee can\u2019t give them voting rights \u2026 It looks like it\u2019s stalled.\u201d\n\nIt could take the bankruptcy judge anywhere from several months to a year just to assess the claim. If Coinlab\u2019s claim is rejected, the company can then litigate it in court, which would take another year. If the court rejects Coinlab\u2019s claim, the company can then appeal, which would also take some time.\n\nAll told, Pag estimates that resolving whether or not Coinlab has a credible claim can take between 18 and 24 months.\n\nOnce that is resolved, only then can the creditors vote on a civil rehabilitation plan (and there is always a chance that there may be competing plans). Depending on the outcome, the potential payout to creditors will be dramatically different as well.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve started that process but it\u2019s not finished and it\u2019s not confirmed, it\u2019s not confirmed that we\u2019re in civil rehabilitation until the creditors vote on a civil rehabilitation plan,\u201d Pag said.\nCoinlab\u2019s claim\n\nSpeaking generally, Sargent told CoinDesk that Coinlab\u2019s suit comes from \u201ca good claim,\u201d adding that \u201cit\u2019s not just something that we made up.\u201d\n\nHe confirmed to CoinDesk that he participated in a brief AMA on Reddit a few weeks ago, where he noted that Mt. Gox did not obtain a dismissal when Coinlab first sued the exchange, which it could have done \u201cif the case were frivolous.\u201d\n\nIn an email, however, former Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpeles told CoinDesk that Coinlab performed \u201cclose to zero\u201d work for the exchange.\n\n\u201cCourts are likely to consider CoinLab\u2019s case with some matter of urgency today and will likely try to get things handled quickly, but CoinLab has likely no interest of bringing a losing battle to its conclusion, and will likely try to extend the process as much as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nCoinlab is in a position of strength right now, \u201cas they hold hostage the whole of Mt Gox\u2019s distribution process,\u201d though the company could end the situation quickly by signing a settlement. If a settlement is signed quickly, bitcoin distribution can begin by the end of 2019.\n\nThis might be the plan too \u2013 according to Pag, \u201ca lot of creditors feel like it\u2019s a very conscious strategy to try and force a settlement from the trustee. Most creditors don\u2019t want them to receive a penny.\u201d\n\nWhile both Pag and his attorney have tried to reach out to the Wada Law Firm, which is representing Coinlab in Japan, neither has received any response.\nHibernation\n\nMt. Gox Legal is, in Pag\u2019s words, the largest creditor group for Mt Gox. There are currently more than 1,000 members claiming more than 150,000 bitcoin, good for roughly 15 percent of the total value owed to creditors.\n\nThe group was founded in fall 2017 to advocate for Mt Gox\u2019s shift from bankruptcy to civil rehabilitation.\n\n\u201cIt started around 18 months ago when it became clear that the price of bitcoin was rising and the assets of the Mt Gox trustee was going to be more than the liabilities,\u201d Pag explained. \u201cTop Japanese lawyers are very expensive so [we pooled together].\u201d\n\nMt. Gox Legal filed for the shift, possibly setting a number of legal precedents in Japan along the way. Pag explained that under such a transition, a company does not normally move from bankruptcy to civil rehabilitation, adding:\n\n    \u201cIt\u2019s rekindling the legal entity enough that you can distribute assets but not restart it as a business.\u201d\n\nPag is currently the coordinator for the group, with his activities overseen by a board of governors. Over the last 18 months, he\u2019s flown to Japan a number of times to communicate with Kobayashi and gather updates for the members of the group.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re quite a considerable creditor body and we\u2019ve spent some time building up a relationship with all the players, the trustee, other creditor groups [and] law firms,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the end of April, he\u2019ll be stepping down.\n\n\u201cThe more bitcoin\u2019s price goes up, the more vultures are circling around. My personal worry is that we\u2019re just going to be bogged down in litigation,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me personally, and it\u2019s a personal decision, it makes more sense to sell my claim.\u201d\n\nMt. Gox Legal\u2019s board has already begun the process to replace him, opening up nominations to bring in a new coordinator. While a new coordinator has not yet been confirmed, Pag expects that the group will likely shift into a hibernation state, as there will not be a lot that can happen until the legal claims have been sorted out.\nMoving on\n\nRather than wait for the court system to sort out whether Coinlab has a legitimate claim, Pag said he intends to sell his claim, step down from Mt. Gox Legal and move on with his life.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve put my career on hold for 18 months and \u2026 It\u2019s just a big regret that we\u2019ve kind of been outplayed by other parties,\u201d he said:\n\n    \u201cIn 2014 I had this money sitting there and it was this great big windfall and it was amazing and I had all these plans that I was going to put into place with it. It\u2019s not losing the money that stung, it\u2019s losing those plans and not being able to doing those things I wanted to do, and there\u2019s a bit of a repeat here.\u201d\n\nA New York-based investment firm will purchase Pag\u2019s claim for $600 per bitcoin. While he declined to name the firm, Pag said if other creditors reached out, he\u2019d be happy to put them in touch.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the windfall that I was hoping for but it\u2019s still a windfall and it\u2019s a windfall today,\u201d he said.\n\nPag said he has seen some backlash for this decision, which he understands. However, \u201cthis is a really personal decision that everyone needs to make for themselves,\u201d he added.\n\nHe is not making a recommendation for other creditors to sell or not sell, Pag said, noting that many creditors have a shared identity born out of the fight to recoup their missing coins.\n\nThat being said:\n\n    \u201cI had to ask myself how far do I stand on principle? When do I say enough is enough. Do I want to be right, or do I want to be happy? I\u2019ve decided I\u2019d rather be happy and get on with my life.\u201d", "Would love to get more details on this.

The low volatility at this point has allowed us to maintain the same analysis on the state of crypto for about a week. \n\nThe support holding from $3330-3400 still remains a crucial level. A break would could result in revisiting 2018-2019 lows. \n\n$3500 has turned into local resistance. A significant close, above $3500, (4hr. Or higher time frame) will have us reevaluate our 75% fiat 25% crypto portfolio allocation.\n\nIn other news, QuadrigaCX, a Canadian digital asset exchange, reportedly owes its customers roughly 190 million USD and has lost access to a majority of these funds!\n\nQuadriga stored a vast amount of the cryptocurrency on their exchange in cold wallets offline. Unfortunately, the only person with access to the offline, secured funds, is the late CEO for Quadriga, Gerald Cotten who passed away in December of 2018.\n\nIt has become apparent to the team that after the CEO\u2019s death, they have now lost the ability to access the locked funds. Cotten took sole responsibility for securing the crypto funds and now that he has passed, any attempt by third parties to extract the data and unlock his personal computer have been unsuccessful.\n\nOur team feels awful for all parties involved as it does not seem that foul play has occurred, but rather a very misfortunate circumstance. \n\nThat being said, we have to question the protocol in place, for QuadrigaCX, as now they have essentially locked away a significant amount of their clients\u2019 money due to faulty security measures. \n\nThis is exactly why we have always preached holding one\u2019s own private keys, personally, and giving trusted family members or loved ones the back up keys needed to access funds in the event of illness or death. Just like in traditional wealth storage, even respected institutions can still ultimately mishandle/mismanage one\u2019s capital which can result in losses like the QuadrigaCX situation. \n\nOne of the most important aspects of this space is the ability to personally protect one\u2019s wealth to the highest capacity, and always remain in control of your funds. Trading is a pivotal aspect of the cryptocurrency space, but using exchanges as long-term wallets is not a practice we use or endorse.\n\nWe will keep you posted on future price action as it unfolds.", "@CoinPaymentsNET Use CoinPayments, THEY ARE THE BEST !!!!!!!

Here's why.\n\nFor years now, big blockers have been unwelcome in the BTC camp. There have been personal attacks, censorship, even \"Scaling Bitcoin\" conferences where nobody was allowed to talk about ways to increase the block size. Everyone really invested in the technology of onchain scaling left BTC between 2014-2018.\n\nMeanwhile BTC is still the home for all the small block tribalists and will remain so. So the ratio of big blockers to small blockers within BTC is worse than ever.\n\nSo if a hard fork occurs,\n\n* all the small blockers\n\n* all the undecideds\n\n* and everyone who isn't paying attention\n\n... follow the non-upgraded chain.  Trying to hard fork an upgrade in these conditions is very very risky and is likely to produce just another minority spinoff like BCH.\n\nPlus you can't roll back Segwit. Not practically. So BTC's codebase remains clunky and encumbered by the legacy of the Segwit SF. And CTOR? Fuhgeddaboudit. There really isn't a practical way for BTC to somehow get on BCH's upgrade path. The two codebases are increasingly incompatible. \n\nThe good news is that if you support big block Bitcoin, you're in the right place. That's what BCH is: *the Bitcoin that got the upgrade.*\n\nBCH has worked for the last 18 months to restore the scaling plan most of us thought we were signing up for before the Segwit guys got in charge: scaling up the protocol to support p2p ecash for casual transactions. With Graphene and xthinner coming online, we have two different block transmission technologies capable of approaching \"Visa-like\" scale. And clients like Flowee are already demonstrating the power of parallel validation (reports are that Flowee can validate the entire historical blockchain in just a few hours on modest hardware). Devs are already working on integrating these technologies into the various BCH clients. It's just a guess, but I think we'll be able to claim \"Visa-like\" scaling achievements within the year. And also IMO, I believe that to be able to credibly claim \"Visa-like\" scaling is the holy grail, the killer app. \n\nBTC had a shot at its scaling plan. It had all the advantages: name recognition, political momentum, and a powerful social media astroturfing campaign. Nevertheless, it failed. BCH kept the original strategy of onchain scaling and is clearly winning the Bitcoin scaling war.\n\nIMO it's just a matter of time before the markets start catching on that they've been betting on the wrong Bitcoin for the last 18 months.\n\nSo you can avoid the upcoming controversial BTC block size debate by trading your broken Bitcoin BTC for upgraded Bitcoin BCH now.", "@crypt0snews It is sad but finally all the investors should move to DEX's.

Further talk about water under this bridge isn't going to motivate people to support Bitcoin Cash.\n\nAs I've said on Twitter, I see Wecx's as participating in an attack on Rizun and Bitcoin Unlimited's credibility, which I find to be petty politicking and very sad. I don't believe it's helping Bitcoin Cash as a whole. When I pointed this out on Twitter, Wecx blocked me.\n\nIf you want to be a KOL, be forward-looking, talk about the things that really matter to those who are coming into contact with Bitcoin Cash, and don't flee from debate.\n\n---\n\n_Going to be offline for a while.

I've designed many items for showing my wife what I'd like to do, or to show my kids what could be done.  I used to just export to CutList Plus and edit my cut lists through Wine.  CutList was developed on a Mac for distribution on Windows & Mac (or so the developer told me).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also designed circuit boards on Eagle when it was available for Linux.  Since Autodesk bought them up, they no longer offer active support for Linux, and I've been lucky enough that KiCAD is an alternative.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I keep coming back to 3d modeling, and I was pretty happy with SketchUp, and that's no longer an option.  I'm no longer able to even install it properly.  I can't seem to get an installer for Fusion360, which is what all the cool kids on YouTube are using.  I'm at the moment still experimenting with Blender, but I haven't even been able to export anything to cutlist plus at this time, because it's not easily possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been using Inkscape for my laser cutting endeavors, and that has worked very well. And the workflow is simple for drawings, and simple designs.  But if I want to make a complex shaped 3d box  without using one of those online generators, it's near impossible to design and make it scalable/dynamic like I see all the cool kids on YouTube and Fusion360.  I've been struggling with getting into larger components because matching things up has been very hard to do.  For example, a wedge with and finger joints is complicated to make sure all edges line up correctly, and even harder if I try to resize items and space them out for cutting.  Something that takes maybe 30 minutes on Fusion360, takes me weeks to complete (several hours across multiple days across multiple weekends). I understand what I have to do, but there's no real way to implement it quickly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been eyeing a Prusa printer, and I'm having to think about how the hell I will implement such a workflow that involves a 3d modeling application (blender most likely), a slicer, and if I have to replicate parts, will it be as intuitive as SketchUp or Fusion360?  I'm scared about making while on an OS that I work and play with all the time.  I'm already looking at gaming with sadness that I have to wait a minimum of a year because most games release on Windows/Apple first, then Linux. I was hoping to play Satisfactory sometime this year, but they went with an Epic exclusive contract, which wont allow them to release on any other OS until sometime in 2020.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Now my overall question: Is there some application setup where  I can design, export designs for laser cutting, plywood cut list, 3d print, or even maintain a sane amount of a workflow on Ubuntu?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think this is just a rant.  I'll go and take the next year or two to learn Blender to design a simple cabinet with shelf to hold my tool boxes on the wall...  Which I know I could have designed, exported to cutlist plus, printed out, and right now in the garage be cutting up wood in the time it took to write this post.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm so stressed/sad about not having the ability to be able to make things with the tools the cool kids use.

Looking at the circulating supply chart, we will get 6 million more new coins over the next 4 years. That\u2019s a 60% addition to the current supply. Wouldn\u2019t that make it a hell of a lot harder for ZEC to increase in price compared to other coins, for the next 4 years, or do you think the halving will offset that issue? My assumption is that in 2024, once ZEC starts leveling off in circulating supply, it will probably rapidly go up in price. \n\n2. ZEC all time low price is $28. There is no coin out there, other than ZEC, that hasn\u2019t been worth pennies at some point in its life. Isn\u2019t there something to be said about that? Big money never has had an opportunity to buy a ton of ZEC for cheap. I know we can\u2019t see wallet statistics, but isn\u2019t it fair to assume there are much less ZEC whales compared to BTC, LTC, and ETH? Wouldn\u2019t that also mean that it is much easier to be a top 1 percent holder for ZEC compared to the 3 I just mentioned?

A balance being spent by an offline tx in this scenario could either become vulnerable to being spent by an attacker or could become invalidated after a grace period has passed to avoid a sudden massive period of currency, monetary inflation that occurs when a miner sweeps up a large amount of vulnerable funds which were not moved from accounts (UTXOs) which were known to be vulnerable.\n* a large change being made to how transactions are constructed in order to allow Bitcoin to scale better to fulfil the monetary, transaction demands of the people of the world.\n\nAlso: many of the reasons a person might want to keep a tx offline, can be solved using an on-chain transaction which makes use of advanced scripting features. BCH has actually had a new op code added called something like check-data-sig-verify, that allows you to commit a tx to the chain, but you can only spend it if you create a specially crafted transaction which contains some very specific signed data. This specific op code feature can be used to solve many of the problems previously \"solved\" by keeping offline transactions.\n\nCSW often speaks truth, but he delivers with it a poisoned payload.\n\nIt is my personal opinion that the agenda of CSW is to destroy the Bitcoin project by going in the extreme opposite direction that the Bitcoin Core guys went. IE instead of tiny, floppy-disk style blocks, BSv is directed towards having absurdly and impractically large blocks to the point where people are literally backing up their data to the blockchain. Instead of highly distributed mining, BSv is directed towards having a small number of super nodes. Instead of the anti-business almost communist style attitude that many Bitcoin Core cult members have, CSW & Co appear to have positioned themselves at the extreme polar opposite of the rainbow spectrum and decided to take a pro-mega-corporation attitude where the small business owner who doesn't get involved in crony capitalism, legal domination (through patents and other aggressive legal infrastructure), and doesn't desire to conquer the world has little chance at competing.\n\nAs with many things in life the answer lies in the green part of the rainbow spectrum; somewhere in the middle where a wise person takes the best of both sides and never leans so far to one side that they fall over. \n\nI think BCH is a little closer to the middle than either BTC or BSv.\n\nCSW also seems obsessed with arbitrary, legal compliance. \"Arbitrary\" because he is selecting the arbitrary rules of arbitrary governments which he wishes to help impose on \"Bitcoin\" users. In particular, for some reason he is very focused on gambling & money laundering. Especially strange when you consider he claims to have been involved in the gambling industry in the past (IIRC) and he has been accused by the Australian government of fraud. I'm not saying that Australian government are correct or right. It's just odd that he seems so in favour of arbitrary, government restrictions when he has been targeted by them himself.\n\nHaving said all that, I wish I could simply say that BCH is the future and the one clear path to economic sovereignty! Sadly I no longer believe that. At least not for now. BCH, BTC and BSv all have one thing in common. They are kingdoms.\n\n* BTC is ruled by Bitcoin Core and ultimately has Greg Maxwell at the throne. At least: Greg is the front man.\n* BSv is ruled by nChain/Bitcoin SV and ultimately has CSW at the throne. At least: CSW is the front man.\n* BCH appears to currently be ruled by Bitcoin ABC and ultimately has deadalnix at the throne, as he is the lead developer of the project, has commit rights and is the public face of the project.\n\nUnlike with BTC and BSv, I **don't** think BCH has a dark, hidden hand behind it that is attempting to direct us towards failure to achieve the original vision of Bitcoin. I think it is merely misguidedness & human ego which has led to Bitcoin ABC taking up this very vulnerable position. It's not even just their fault. The miners do not know their own sovereignty and the role they are supposed to play in order to make Bitcoin a truly permissionless, decentralized, censorship resistant, p2p electronic cash system. We (as economic users of BCH and as miners) have even been offered [a path](https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/blob/dev/doc/bip135-guide.md) towards decentralized governance by Bitcoin Unlimited. So far it seems \"we\" have chosen not to take it. \n\nWhen the vulnerable central point of power within BCH is eventually co-opted by outside forces, the failure of the Bitcoin project will not be on Bitcoin ABC; it will be on us.\n\nIf it seems like I am repeating this last point over and over, it's because I am. I see nothing more important than this issue.  This issue is...\n\n* more important than how we order transactions (CTOR vs TTOR vs LORDZOR vs WOODSAW)\n* It's more important than exactly how Bitcoin scales (paraphrasing what Gavin Andresen said: don't let far-in-the-future, potential problems stop us from solving present day problems. Let's keep moving towards success (p2p cash) and we'll solve the real problems as we get to them or get close to them. He also said something like \"don't let perfect be the enemy of good enough\". That guy is a wise man). \n* This issue is more important than what stupid shit the Bitcoin Core cult members are repeating or who CSW is currently suing. \n\nIf Bitcoin (BCH) has a single, centralized point of officialdom, it **will** be attacked. Anyone who is even vaguely awake, slightly knowledgeable of how the current fiat money systems works and mildly aware of the history of BTC will **know** what I just said to be true.\n\nGood luck to you.", "\"Plus500 Shares Slump to Two-Year Low After Revenue Collapses\" via NYT https://t.co/63saWMez0M #ethereum #litecoin https://t.co/le6qjkGPyN", "Maishapay is a financial service that relies on blockchain technology.

This is a fallacy.  Decentralized networks are in their infancy and no DApp platform has proven viability on a large scale.  This due to the low demand in this nascent market coupled with real architectural limitations imposed by this distributed and headless database concept.  Inline with the space exploration metaphor, the engineering, scientific and social psychology problems are real and decidedly unsolved by the current crop of incumbents.  A competitor is yet to land on the \u2018Moon\u2019. \n\n2) All DApp platforms are of equal value and of like composition.  This is a fallacy.  First movers like ETH are completely overhauling their architecture and cribbing from the Cardano playbook as the limitations in their architecture have reared themselves in the last cycle. EOS has sacrificed decentralization in favor of federation to push out a functional product that suffers from exponential data-bloat and the liabilities of running nodes on centralized Amazon Web Servers.  This defeats the whole point of decentralization and will not service the needs of the next gen of DApps \n\n3) The winning decentralized network will manifest itself quickly; the market knows this and is already voting with the dollars.  This is a fallacy.  The winner in the DApp platform space (and there may be a few) is still years out.

Cardano is right to be in a research, exploration, experimentation and best practices mindset.   Markets are largely sentiment driven and irrational.

To me this means 2 things:\n\n1) Building/creating contributions that benefit users and/or enhance the value of the network \n2) Sharing their forged LSK with voters and possibly even non-voters\n\nI don't want cartels. In other words, I don't think it would be beneficial to have large groups who demand to all be voted for as a pool to share their rewards with those who have voted for them. It goes against the vision of decentralization. We need decentralization to have the Dapps and the Dexs that the community dreams of.\n\nHowever, collaboration among delegates is desirable, as they can help problem solve. Also, it would be challenging and probably a bad idea to attempt to punish any sort of teaming up and pooling of resources among any groups of delegates. So some pools are inevitable. And pools of the right size (small) may even be desirable for collaboration purposes. \n\nIs there a way we can create a voting structure that punishes large groups who attempt to coordinate requests for voting? \n\nSimilarly, are there ways to incentivize delegates who operate individually, even if individually means more than one person sharing that delegate spot?\n\nIt seems low voting fees and a simple voting process are essential to any effective democratic process. Accurate information on delegates performance and contributions being readily available for voters is also important. Perhaps a future Dapp will provide verifiable information on delegates performance and contributions in a trustless manner. People with a stake in the network will do some simple homework to ensure the best 101, or at least very close to it, are overseeing the network. \n\nDo this voting thing right and you get a self sufficient beast of a decentralized human system. \n\nSo how many votes? More than 1, for all the reasons people have already mentioned here and on Lisk Research. I think less than 101 because if we each hold 101 votes or more people will probably just go with greed and ease over careful decisionmaking. \n\nSo maybe 33? Or 66? Or 50? Maybe 37 because of the 37% rule?\n\n", "The only sad part: Flexacoin is an ERC20 Ethereum token  #flexacoin #ethereum #cryptocurrency", "RT @joselitommutuc: Im not a good trader, I just mostly HODL AERGO till it moons!\nThe rule is dont buy high and sell low, instead buy low a", ">Luca Crisciotti \"Our low carbon ecosystem is a concept that can be applied to any kind of industries.

During the demonstration, Weis pointed out that the maximum withdrawal limit is 20 HKD, roughly $2.55 USD or 0.00061893 BTC. Leo Weese, who organized the hackathon, was able to make a similar withdrawal (https://twitter.com/LeoAW/status/1112282484308238336).Most Bitcoin ATMs that exist today do not execute as quickly as Weis\u2019s modified one did in the video, not because they don\u2019t utilize Lightning but because they often require some form of know-your-customer (KYC) compliance that delays the process by requiring users to visit a website and provide their personal information as they would on a custodial exchange.A Different Kind of Bitcoin ATMA Lightning-enabled Bitcoin ATM as demonstrated by Weis could provide several key advantages over its predecessors. With the average Bitcoin ATM, customers looking to withdraw a typical amount of bitcoin will need to wait at least a few minutes before receiving it, over which the value of the withdrawn amount might fluctuate slightly.While this may not significantly affect a customer\u2019s purchasing power, a Lightning-enabled Bitcoin ATM offers a significant advantage in this department due to its near-instantaneous payment delivery. Lightning enables bitcoin micropayments and, coupled with the rapid speed of a Lighting transaction, a Lightning-enabled ATM allows for satoshi-level invoice precision. In other words, customers can withdraw a precise amount as close to the fiat conversion rate as possible and receive it in essentially real time.As Weis told Bitcoin Magazine, one \u201cmajor benefit of the Lightning Network\u201d integration on Bitcoin ATMs would be instant withdrawals on two-way machines. This contrasts with on-chain transactions which \u201ccan take from minutes to hours if the customer (unknowingly) chose a low mining fee.\u201dStill, there are a few speed bumps in the way of bringing Lightning to every Bitcoin ATM. Weis told Bitcoin Magazine that, in order for this to be implemented in other ATMs, ATM operators will have to run their own Lightning nodes and make sure they have enough in- and outbound liquidity. In addition, he said that the current software does not accommodate instantaneous withdrawals but that he hopes to code this functionality \u201cvery soon.\u201dWeis said that his plugin is compatible with any General Bytes Bitcoin ATM in Hong Kong, a hardware and software company that produces Bitcoin-related products.\n\n          \n\n          This article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine (https://bitcoinmagazine.com/).", "My Passive Trades\nLow Risk, Long Term, Legitimate Trading And Advertising Company\n\nJoin This Company https://t.co/QSKVWa7CMo", "RT @btcfork: @ToneVays Bitcoin Cash is already successful at preserving Bitcoin's ledger and user experience with fast, low-fee transaction", " \"TROUBLE AND WOE\" (1:37) https://t.co/JCtWPAZXkK #Music #Video #Song #Indie #BMI #SEO #P2P #BlockChain https://t.co/GFo3f9JcRD", "While the economy is unstable in some countries, more and more people get into crypto.

Wondering how to store your coins? With so many crypto wallets out there it can be very tricky to decide where exactly to keep your digital currency, right? But here we are \u2013 an incredibly friendly [Stealthex](https://stealthex.io/) team \u2013 to guide and help you realize which type of wallet is just right for you.\n\nLet\u2019s start with some basics. **What is a cryptocurrency wallet?** In simple terms, it is a kind of a digital equivalent of a bank account that allows you to store, send and receive digital coins. The main feature is that crypto wallets have two important components: a public key and a private key. The ***public key*** is a wallet address to which anyone can send you coins. The ***private key*** is both a login and a password used to access your currency.\n\nThe other feature of crypto wallets is the fact that they don\u2019t actually store currency in any physical form. And when someone sends you crypto, they are essentially signing off ownership of their coins to the address of your wallet. The transaction is confirmed by a record on the blockchain and a change in a balance in your crypto wallet.\n\nThere are different classifications of wallets. Let\u2019s go through **the main types and features of digital wallets**.\n\n**1. Classification by type of access to the wallet:**\n\n* *Hot wallets*. These ones have access to the Internet and a blockchain in particular. They are considered \u2018hot\u2019 because of the greater ability for activity and accessibility. Just like cash in your pocket.\n\nPros: can help you make transactions in the blink of an eye, user-friendly.\n\nCons: security risks.\n\n* *Cold wallets.* These are stored offline most of the time. Cold wallets are some kind of a safe where you can store a great number of digital coins for a long time.\n\nPros: high level of security.\n\nCons: not easy to access, low speed.\n\n**2. Classification by wallet\u2019s \u201cweight\u201d:**\n\n* *Heavy wallets*. Require downloading the entire blockchain, which will later be stored on a computer occupying a significant place on your hard disk.\n\nPros: no risks of transferring personal information over the network.\n\nCons:  risk of getting a virus on your computer, usage inconvenience.                                           \n\n* *Light wallets.* These ones access the blockchain via third-party services and therefore do not require downloading and storing the entire blockchain on a computer.\n\nPros: independence \u2013 you can choose which service to use, very easy to handle.\n\nCons: risk of hackers attack.\n\n**3. Classification by the ways of private key storage:**\n\n* *Desktop wallets*. These are downloaded and installed on your computer which gives you some security as you are unable to access this wallet from anywhere else aside from the actual desktop.\n\nPros: good security level, convenience, a great choice of wallets, free downloads.\n\nCons: risk of computer viruses and hacker attacks.\n\nExamples: Exodus, Bitcoin Core.\n\n* *Mobile wallets.* Run as an app on your phone, storing your private keys and allowing you to make transactions directly from your phone.\n\nPros: simple, very handy, free downloads.\n\nCons: risk of hacking, losing or damaging your phone which will lead to problems with access to your crypto.\n\nExamples:\u00a0Xapo, Coinomi.\n\n* *Online wallets*. These run on a cloud service owned by a third party. In this case, the private keys are located on remote servers. This type of wallet allows users not only to open several addresses for different cryptocurrencies but also to trade on exchanges, estimate commissions using the built-in calculator and so on.\n\nPros: easy to use, able to work with multiple cryptocurrencies, high transaction speed.\n\nCons: security risks, additional expenses such a commission to the service.\n\nExamples: HolyTransaction, Coinbase.\n\n* *Hardware wallets*. The transactions are made online, but the private key is stored offline on a USB stick or a specially designed piece of hardware. These wallets can be considered as cold wallets until they are offline.\n\nPros: very high level of security, easy to set up and use.\n\nCons: expensive ($150-200), inconvenient if you need fast access to your coins.\n\nExamples:\u00a0 KeepKey, Trezor.\n\n* *Paper wallets*. A unique storage option representing a printed QR-code containing a public address and a private key. It is a super cold wallet. Great option for long-term storage for those who do not trust gadgetry.\n\nPros: highest level of security.\n\nCons: \u00a0risk of destruction or loss of paper that contains wallet info, totally not for beginners.\n\nExample: bitaddress.org.\n\nAs you can see there is no such thing as the best crypto wallet. The right wallet for you will be the one that matches your needs and the purpose of your cryptocurrency savings.\n\nIf you have any questions or comments, please hit us up in the comments below.\n\n*Follow us on* [*Medium*](https://medium.com/@stealthex.io)*,* [*Twitter*](https://twitter.com/Stealthex_io)*,* [*Facebook*](https://www.facebook.com/Stealthex.io)*, and* [*Reddit*](https://www.reddit.com/user/Stealthex_io) *to get*[*Stealthex.io*](http://stealthex.io/) *updates and the latest news about the crypto world.

This would be peer-to-peer electronic cash. Well, what would the fees be at just the minimum fee?\n\n5 transactions per day per person for 10 Billion people, we'd need 50 Billion tx per day, which would be 5 terabyte of block data per day at 100 bytes per transaction. This is 21GB per block on average. At 1 sat/byte, this would be 21 billion satoshis per block on average. That's 210 Bitcoin per block.\n\nSo at some level Bitcoin's minimum fee will need to drop if it really becomes global cash. But can we get an idea when this will be a problem?\n\nBitcoin started 2013 at 20k transactions/day and doubled every year from 20k, 40k, 80k, 160k, and the 300k for the start of 2017. This metric later fell over the long term for the first time in it's history to 150k-200k per day by this time last year. Today, it's mixed with Veriblock and running into the ceiling, so it's usefulness as a metric is basically done, but for those curious it's around 400k/day.\n\nBCH, on the other hand, has been at a sad 10k/day for the past year. But in the past 3 months, has grown from an average of ~10k/day to ~40k/day. This is now suddenly Jan 2014 level.\n\nIf we assume BCH later grows like BTC or BTC increase the blocksize(lul), then we can extrapolate from Bitcoin's original growth to get some idea. We get to 1M, 2M, 4M, 8M, 16M, 32M, 64M, 128M, 256M, and ~512M tx/day 10 years from today at ~500k. That's still far from 50B per day, but we'd already have 2.133 Bitcoin in fees at 1 sat/byte. That's only 2 or 3 more halvenings away.\n\nBTW, since I know it's going to come up, 1GB blocks are possible on commodity hardware today, so the feasibility of 21GB blocks is not only high, it's downright impossible the imagine it won't happen.

For a lot of investors this would be a lot easier to stomach if the entire market was following suit but that clearly isn't the case. A year ago .005 was seen as a gift of a price for those who didn't buy in at the ICO. Now .005 seems fairly overvalued as many price projections have fallen to more realistic levels of .01 to 02 cents being the new ATH's within the next year or so, instead of .20 cents or even a dollar. Personally, If we are going to continue this trend I would like to see a bottom of .0035. That way I can really load up with a lot less capital and put this project on the back burner until the next bitcoin halving and see where the price at that time. Electroneum is sitting on a ton of cash and they aren't known for wasting money, so I'm not worried about them dying off anytime soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDespite all of the real world work towards mass adoption that's being put into this coin, for whatever reason, people just seem to like it at all. Whether you like to admit it or not YouTubers have A LOT of sway when it comes to certain coins and almost all of the top dogs aren't shy about writing Electroneum off whenever a community members brings them up. Of course general ignorance plays a big part into this as well. Where you have folks who didn't buy bitcoin at $3k but won't hesitate to take out a loan to buy it once it surpasses $13k. Then there's the KYC aspect, of which most people will learn, KYC is apart of ETN but may never realize that it can easily be circumvented with the use of paper wallets. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEither way, I think for a lot of people they are at a crossroads with ETN. For those who bought in over a penny they may feel as though they should just cut their losses short and just move on and try their best not be bitter and shit on the project like many others have. Or for those like me, who had the chance to load up in at ICO prices, they may be tempted to sell ETN now before it goes any lower so they can take advantage of other opportunities out there and potentially just buy back their positions 3-6 months from now or whenever. Point is, it would just suck to see your money either slowing diminishing or just not turning over any profit at all over the course of a year plus. A year is simply too long to wait in crypto to be completely honest. Especially, as you become more aware of other opportunities that are extremely lucrative and often transpire within day or weeks at a time. And often times these other project aren't nearly as put together and transparent as ETN, which only adds insult to injury.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not trying to shill here but a perfect example for me would be COVA. Despite the uphill battle that it has as being just another new smart contract, all of that really doesn't matter when you look at the amount of money being thrown at it. Ivy league founded, huge daily volumes, venture capital backing by some of THE biggest players  in the crypto space, coupled with the fact that it's basically brand new token so the price is super low, with so much upside potential in terms of further exchange listing and so on. Long story short, I made more off that coin in one month than some people make in a year. And this was just off of two weeks of worth of due diligence and research.

Several months ago I was blessed with the opportunity to travel to Seoul, South Korea. While there, I met and befriended a native Korean speaker and full time translator.\n\nI recognized that Korean has been one of the more difficult languages to find translators for the Monero Community so I explained to my friend how the Monero CCS (FFS at the time) works and proposed a contractual agreement.\n\nMy friend knows basically nothing about the crypto community or Monero apart from the brief explaination I provided during our discussion.\n\nStill, I believe with my help to guide them along and clarify their understanding of the technology we can switfly translate the Monero GUI and CLI wallets.\n\nIf all goes well, I am sure they would be interested in translating other Monero documentation like the GetMonero Website, Monerujo, and other resources. \n\n**WHAT** Currently the Korean translation for the GUI has 2255 words incomplete and 7220 words incomplete for the CLI. Totaling 9475 words.\n\nI have offered them $0.08 per word and agreed to facilitate the process of setting up this CCS, corresponding with the Monero Community, and assisting them with the Pootle translation process.\n\nI am requesting $758 as their compensation for completing the GUI and CLI Korean Translations.\n\nThese 9475 words can be broken down into a total of 1377 separate strings.\n\nI project that it will take us approximately 10 working hours to translate all of these strings.\n\nFor my time, I am requesting $20 per hour totalling $200.\n\nIn total for this project I am requesting $958.\n\nUsing a 30 day exponential moving average of $60 per XMR, this comes to 16 XMR.\n\n**WHEN** I am requesting payouts be made at quarterly for every 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% completion milestones.\n\n**WHY** Translations are one of the most important elements of the Monero Ecosystem and the Korean market is one of the largest (if not the largest) in terms of global trading volume. \n\nHaving available and accessible Monero Korean Translations will allow more interested users and investors to learn about this world changing technology.", "@Vino101net Short term.

VeChain can only address this by either: \n\n\n1) Reduce amount of VTHO needed per transaction\n\n\nCurrent VTHO generation rate already far outstrips the burn rate, so this will make each VTHO worth even less since demand will drop.\n\n\nor\n\n\n2) Increasing VTHO generation rate. This increases supply of VTHO while demand remains unchanged, which also results in each VTHO being worth less.\n\n\n**Both have the same net effect of driving VTHO price down.**\n\n\nSo my question is this, how will VET ever be worth more if the objective is always to keep price per transaction low? When more companies come onboard, VTHO's burn rate goes up, and VTHO price will rise accordingly. Then companies will again complain about the high price of VTHO, and VeChain will again have to take either of the above 2 steps to reduce VTHO price.\n\n\nIf price of VTHO is to be kept low, how will VET's valuation ever rise? Considering its primary use is to generate VTHO. Low value of generated VTHO = low value of VET.\n\n\nI wish there is something wrong with my reasoning, so if you spot any, please let me know.", " [https://mobile.twitter.com/rgrottola/status/1114234290898984960](https://mobile.twitter.com/rgrottola/status/1114234290898984960) \n\nDid a little bit of digging after seeing this from Renato. \n\nHere's the event corresponding to the hashtag: #Sum03\n\n [https://www.gianrobertocasaleggio.com/](https://www.gianrobertocasaleggio.com/) \n\nScrolled down and checked the Agenda \"Programma Lavori\"\n\n [https://www.gianrobertocasaleggio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SUM03\\_Programma\\_lavori.pdf](https://www.gianrobertocasaleggio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SUM03_Programma_lavori.pdf) \n\nBlockchain section: \n\nSunny talking about the \"low carbon\" example :)\n\n&#x200B;", " CELER NETWORK AIRDROP \n\n Celer Network Bring interactive, secure and low-cost applications to every blockchain. https://t.co/zYgRuMX9F6", "Important\nBack to Basics: What Is #Money?\n\nWho Controls Fiat Money?\nThe Great Depression and Bank Runs\n\nThe Intern https://t.co/2puldo8bWG", "Wine &amp; Spirits Outside Sales Representative - Los Angeles, California - BevStrat - [  More Info https://t.co/lqPEvOi6eP", "I live Bitcoin all day !

The LN throws out all of the reasons for having decentralization in the first place.\n\n**The LN is not fast**: To make an LN transaction you first need to on-board, lock up funds, make your transaction and then off-board. This entire process could take from hours to days. Further, an unacceptable percentage of LN transactions fail because they can't find the destination or funds aren\u2019t available. This is hard or impossible to fix because the  funding/transfer issues that Peter Rizun has talked extensively about.\n\n**The LN is not cheap**: The LN is a double-toll road: you pay a full on-chain transaction to get on it and then you pay a full on-chain transaction to get your actual BTC out. It takes two transactions to use the tab/iou system. Once you\u2019re in that system you pay fees to middlemen who do nothing but act as an intermediary. Further, your money could be lost if those intermediaries don\u2019t play by the rules.\n\n**The LN is Censorable**: The LN introduces middlemen who do nothing to secure the network. You have to pay them fees to move your funds while they can also potentially freeze your transactions. If you don't have enough funds to settle on-chain then you lose your money. The LN won't actually function properly without some sort of centralization run by companies and you can also be sure that they will be required to add KYC/AML if the LN becomes widely used. Privacy is about dignity for most people, not for doing bad things. \n\n**The LN is not peer-to-peer**: The LN requires you to trust that several intermediaries will just play along. You have to be online 24/7 or be forced to trust/use another *service* called a lighthouse in order to receive transactions.  if you don't have enough liquidity, that\u2019s another service you have to trust - and you can bet that bankers are looking for every way to steal your money just for making a transaction.\n\nJust ask yourself: is the LN better or different than the modern banking cartels? I think you'll find that the LN is a sad attempt to cripple Bitcoin's actual usage while hyping the price. This is exactly what big banks want, another asset class that doesn't disrupt their day to day scamming operations (modern banking).\n\nThis is why Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin. It matches the original Bitcoin Whitepaper and continues working as peer-to-peer electronic cash. Bitcoin Cash can also scale 100x or more what BTC can, and it does it on-chain.

Sure it is.\" But then adds \u201c. . . in the meantime, \"if you buy cryptocurrency, you get no income. It's not a real investment. It's speculation.\"\n\nMallouk knows that speculators make money, sometimes a lot of money. One of the reasons for that is that they (sometimes) earn no compensation before cashing out. In other words, the risk they took in not earning dividends and yields is compensated for if and when their initial buy-in pays off. But as a practical matter the distinction between \u201cspeculation\u201d and \u201cinvestment\u201d is academic. Taking stock options instead of higher pay is a form of speculation. And many stocks pay no dividends or very small ones, and bonds often yield very little \u2013 depending, of course, on how risky \u2013 speculative \u2013 such bonds are. As for real estate which Mallouk also recommends, the rent you earn is proportionate to the cost of owning that real estate \u2013 unless you speculate and buy land that has low value now but may have high value later. In the interim, you may not earn any rent or rent so low it won\u2019t pay for your investment for years.\n\nMallouk then makes the usual nod to \u201cblockchain technology\u201d but adds \u201cthat doesn't mean that bitcoin is going to work out or ripple is going to work out.\u201d He then obliviously states \u201cPalm and Blackberry were fantastic, but Apple came in and took them out. Lycos and Excite were here before Google,\u201d clearly unaware that Bitcoin and Ripple and (Ethereum) may be the Apples and Googles of the financial world.\n\nJim Cramer unsurprisingly gets it wrong as well. Bitcoin is a \u201cpure gamble\u201d and \"kind of like Monopoly money \\[showing he has no understanding of, or possibly any knowledge of, mining\\]. It's just pure gambling at this point. I mean, if you want to gamble, go to Vegas. Vegas is fabulous.\u201d\n\nTo quote Edgar Allen Poe, \u201cObserve, here, the laughable confusion of thought!\" If bitcoin is pure gambling, you clearly don\u2019t need to go to Vegas to gamble. But worse \u2013 and this from a financial adviser (of sorts), Cramer is saying that you should not take the money a trip to Vegas would cost and put it into Bitcoin instead. That\u2019s pretty bad. You *should* put it into bitcoin instead.\n\nAs for Dimon\u2019s comments, they have been largely superseded by Dimon himself.\n\nRegarding all this I will paraphrase the old Chinese saying and state that *It\u2019s earlier than you think.*\n\n\\[Various minor edits added.\\]\n\n&#x200B;", "Pretty stoked about the rebranding from @dragonchaingang  But at the same time very sad my favourite dragon will c https://t.co/PEWom6DUtG", "RT @propelzach: I know optimism is really low in the #cryptocurrency space right now.

It's definitely \u20ac10 that I'd prefer to have in my own posession!\n\nSo I looked at amalgamating them into one currency to withdraw - but the minimum volumes for orders on this particular exchange were significantly higher than the amounts involved. I realised I'd have to sub in some external crypto to 'sweep up' the smaller bits and withdraw it all together.\n\nXlm to the rescue - incredibly quick deposit onto the exchange, tiny fee to get it there, the trades went off without a hitch, and then withdrew my slightly bigger xlm stack at the end. It was back in my stargazer account before I finish checking my emails, all at a minimal cost.\n\nI dread to think of how much of an ordeal, and how much more expensive it would have been if I had to use btc, or even ltc for that matter. Almost everyone here will know xlm is king in terms of convenience and low transaction cost, and so did I.

For example this bet has gone through 9 dispute rounds and is 7 rounds away from forking Augur:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://reporters.chat/markets/0x60666348411eccbb0b11346c368461fd2b48df1b](https://reporters.chat/markets/0x60666348411eccbb0b11346c368461fd2b48df1b) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFaction A thinks reporting invalid on many markets is OK even if there are valid interpretation paths. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFaction A draws hard lines from their own history of precedents and err on the side of invalid resolutions. Most of the reporters in the Augur discord I talked to were Faction A. They have a hard set of rules they follow and if scammers are predictably gaming those rules its bad luck for the newbies. These reporters aren't swayed by how Augur outcomes compare to the outside world's idea of fairness. They accept that many newbie Augur traders will learn the rules by getting scammed. They believe Augur newbies should log into the discord before making bets and should check with them, the Augur insiders, whether a bet is valid. I was told in the Augur discord that traders should know they are meant to visit the channel first to make sure markets are valid before betting. They say Layer 2 or Version 2 will fix the problems and until then its bad luck for the newbies. To me they make Augur v1 into a venus fly trap for newbies.    \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFaction B thinks reporting invalid on markets is not OK if there is a valid interpretation path. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFaction B draws hard lines that err on the side of valid resolutions. They say v1 has too many scammers and this is because of the way that invalid resolutions divide up the funds instead of refunding. These reporters consider how bugs and broken features effect newbie traders who approached v1 in good faith. These reporters consider how Augur outcomes compare to the outside world's idea of fairness. It seems most of these reporters are newbies or have an outer world perspective of Augur. They think Augur insiders shouldn't take advantage of newbies lack of knowledge. These reporters have zero tolerance for scammers and want to set precedents when predictable scams appear. They want to show the outside world that they will protect newbie traders when predictable scams appear. They think reporter rules can adapt to the bugs that arise, take predictable scams into consideration and avoid invalid outomes especially in v1. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy view is that Faction B is the smarter way to be for Augur. But it seems that is not the majority faction at the moment. I played the Faction B devils advocate strongly and am grateful for the fascinating engagement from Faction A reporters. If Faction A turns out to be wrong seems they will only learn their lessons about outer world fairness if they lose big disputes or if Augur forks. Even in case of a fork they calculate that after a fork the devs will simply side with them. So for them the whole concept of Augur disputing to a fork comes down to who the devs side with. They are determined to play out the precedent of tolerating scammers in favor of keeping their estabilshed rigid reporting rules even though those rules have lead to a scammer boom. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy view for Augur v1 is that the Faction A reporting method has already failed newbie traders. If we want to attract new liquidity shouldn't we make Augur v1 work for newbies today and not tell them \"sorry just wait for Augur v2\". What if Augur v2 has newbie problems as well?  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe major take away is that Augur v1 is not ready for newbies. There are a lot of scam markets that are being made invalid. Maybe Veil as a layer above the Augur clients can add protections and warnings to assist traders. But its definately early days and bugs or complicated nuances could end up costing newbies funds. Newbies should be careful betting and reporting. Even if you bet on the \"right\" outcome Faction A reporters could make your bet invalid and there are no full refunds. ", "Know what makes me sad?

I think we need to nip this in the bud now.\n\nIf you increase the blocksize then you will decrease fees, thus making it easier for Veriblock and Coinbase to spam the network and never bother to optimise their platforms. When VeriBlock temporarily paused their system, confirmed on-chain transactions dropped from [\\~325,000/day to \\~225,000/day.](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/n-transactions) That should give you a sense as to just how much spam is being caused by low fees.\n\nIf we go to 2MB, those companies will fill blocks up again. Fees will rise to the exact same level in a short period. Now you've got the same situation as before, except a whole lot of full node operators can't keep up with the bandwidth so turn their nodes off. Blocks will propagate through the network slower, centralising mining and providing an unfair advantage to the previous block winner.\n\nThe final point, which really should shut this whole discussion down, is that **we've already been through this. Bcash exists.** It had the same code base as bitcoin at the time of the split. If that's how you think Bitcoin should operate, then just use bcash and be done with it. LN can be built on top of bcash, it's just barely anyone wants to develop for it because overwhelmingly technical people understand why raising the blocksize is a bad idea.\n\nIf you're right, bcash will overtake Bitcoin and you can tell everyone I told you so.

In 2019, no single mining pool controls more than 20% of the Bitcoin network hash rate. Comparatively, in 2014, one mining pool controlled roughly 50% of the network\u2019s hash rate! \n\nThe continued development of mining technology in the space has allowed more market participants to become miners, thereby further decreasing the centralization of Bitcoin\u2019s network. This is a MUST for the long-term prospects of cryptocurrency and decentralized monetary systems. \n\nThe goal of Bitcoin and many other various cryptos is to provide  a decentralized system of money so that no one party can control how it operates \u270a.

Sadly, this was a pretty unpleasant experience. But one I want to share with you guys. Maybe it can help someone with the same problems, maybe we can improve something. So let me start my story.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI checked a few delivery services in my area and found one that offers Bitcoins as a payment method. Since I never really used Bitcoin for payments I thought, let's try this and maybe I can even convince my wife that Bitcoin is pretty useable now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I chose my Pizza and some food for the wife and went on to pay for it. I had some Bitcoin (about 20 USD) on my phone wallet (Eclair) and thought that should be an easy deal. Yeah, how wrong I was...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI got to the payment process and they forwarded me to Bitpay. First thing I see is \"choose your currency\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\no) Bitcoin (network cost 0.50 USD)\n\no) Bitcoin Cash (network cost 0.00 USD)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt kinda felt like they wanted to push me towards BCH (maybe that's just me). But it's still nice to have some options to pay. Especially because the food delivery service only offered Bitcoin payments on his homepage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the same time, a countdown started to finish my payment before the order gets rejected (about 15 min).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I chose Bitcoin and got a QR code I can scan to pay it. I scanned the code with my wallet and got the error \"This is not a valid Bitcoin address\". Well, shit. My countdown was already down to 12 minutes so I had to hurry and figure out what's wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext step I tried to copy the address and paste it into my wallet, but still not working. I was just getting some strange looking link (bitcoin:?r=[https://bitpay.com/i/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx](https://bitpay.com/i/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)). Countdown was down to 10 minutes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter that, I looked it up on google and saw that Bitpay seemingly tries to force feed their own wallet on you to make payments. Since I didn't want to download their wallet or even send my money there (especially because I only had a few minutes left), I looked further and found some help on Bitcointalk. Some users there found a way around this with using a decoder that changes the Bitpay link into an actual Bitcoin address. ([https://decoder.bip70.org/](https://decoder.bip70.org/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe site itself didn't look that trustworthy but since I only got about 3 minutes left I went on to gave it a try. I sent my Bitcoin to the decoded address. And look there, it worked. Bitpay told me they see my payment but we need to wait for confirmation. But wait, there is more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince I didn't look into the payment details I did send a little bit too much money (included too much transaction fees). So I ended up paying something like 3x the from Bitpay recommended fee. But I didn't mind that so much. What troubled me was the message Bitpay showed me, it was something like that:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"This payment was made with a low bitcoin miner fee, which may prevent it from being accepted by the bitcoin network. This is an issue with the configuration of your bitcoin wallet. If the transaction doesn't confirm, the funds will be again in your wallet in about 48-72 hours.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I was like, what? How could the fee be to low if I used three times more than recommended? Should I now wait 72 hours before ordering a new Pizza? Becoming more and more hungry I still decided to wait out and see if my transactions will get confirmed. And my patience got rewarded, about half an hour later they confirmed my payment and the order got routed to the Pizza Restaurant. An hour later I finally got my Pizza and it was delicious. Well, maybe because I was already dying because I was so hungry but still. At least I had a happy end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNeedlessness to say, I couldn't convince my wife to use Bitcoin for further Pizza deliveries. Moreover, I can't even recommend it to anyone new to Bitcoin because that was quite a shitty experience. Mostly because of Bitpay I would argue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't get me wrong, I really love Bitcoin and the opportunities it provides.  But it seems, we still have a long way to go for mass adoption (or even an easy way to order Pizza).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince I would love to improve that process I thought about sending that delivery service some feedback. To even give them an opportunity to improve, I think they would have to move away from Bitpay to another payment service. Anything you guys can recommend for Europe?", "My heart hurts.

We are still operating under the idea that $BTC is in a bull flag, but the volume profile over the course of the past 72 hours is disheartening, leaving us to believe there is strong bearish momentum \ud83e\udd12. We may need to see lower prices before buyers step in. \n\n$BTC has interacted with the 200MA (4hr) multiple times and appears to have found support. We are not sure how many more times it will provide support, but we have outlined a few other areas of support and resistance in the charts below \ud83d\udc47.\n\nAt this point, we are still holding Alts because we believe that cryptocurrency markets are showing HTF bullish signals \ud83d\udc02. Our analysis may change if $BTC loses support from $3550-3570.\n\nIn other news, LocalBitcoins, a peer-to-peer Bitcoin exchange, hit an all time volume high this week. The equivalent of 9 million USD was traded for $BTC in Venezuela. This is roughly 156x the traded volume on Venezuela\u2019s largest stock exchange! \ud83e\udd2f\n\nVenezuela is in a state of utter distress, as a currency collapse is occurring under the weight of economic and financial mismanagement by the Venezuelan government. Venezuelan currency inflated 1.3 mm% in 2018 alone, which is essentially a double occurring every 19 days. Imagine your monthly rent doubling every 19 days without an increase in wage that matches the inflation of your rent! \ud83d\ude35\n\nIt is sad to witness the current state of distress occurring in Venezuela, but this is ultimately why having access to a deflationary currency such as Bitcoin is important \ud83d\udc4d. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin doesn\u2019t allow for its deflationary component to be changed by a governing body. This ultimately solves the problem Venezuelans are facing right now and is why we see LocalBitcoins' volume correlated tightly with the inflation of their government backed currency.\n\nThis is a core principle of why $BTC is important to finance and economics on an international scale. We just hope that we don\u2019t have to witness the world experience the hardship of the Venezuelan people in order to adopt Bitcoin out of necessity rather than financial innovation.", "\"As a technical man, I feel very sad that the TRON has departed from the faith of decentralize the web...\" https://t.co/Or9qSYRiQ8", "Important\nBack to Basics: What Is #Money?\n\nWho Controls Fiat Money?\nThe Great Depression and Bank Runs\n\nThe Intern https://t.co/VnkghpLq0D", "RT @CryptoPriceBTC: Bitcoin Overview - 24 Hour:\n\nAverage $BTC price across exchanges: $5,362.39\nChange: $39.39 (+0.74%)\nHigh: $5,385.62\nLow", "RT @ayokings: $FET https://t.co/LdlbgMzNvC  \n  AI + Internet of Things (IoT) Blockchain Tech  \n Low Circulating supply 91 Million FET \n", "Ease and low costs of blockchain deployment is key to success.

Accounts get hacked, hardware gets hacked, things get gotten into. Putting yourself out there in ways much like many people have done lately is not the best idea.

Bitcoin is a leading indicator for how we believe alts will perform. As of right now, Bitcoin has broken above multiple points of control, including one such level around $3800 \ud83d\udcaa. \n\nWe believe this rally will continue so long as $BTC can remain above $3966 (Bitmex Pricing) on 4hr time frames and higher\u23f3.\n\nAt this point in time, to generate profit from greater potential upside (90% crypto, 10% fiat), our team is adding to its longs and increasing its exposure to alts. We will be utilizing the index strategy that we have previously mentioned to aggregate ourselves across top 30 market cap cryptos. \n\nCase and point, we want to have high exposure to alts, here, as they typically act with more volatility than $BTC, in whatever way the market trends. If $3966 (Bitmex Pricing) doesn\u2019t hold, then we will hedge ourselves neutral with shorts to protect against ensuing downside \u274c. \n\nWe will circle back with you guys this afternoon (PM U.S. Central Time) to discuss updated price action and relevant news in the space.", "Claire at this hour:\n\n\"AKU BROKEN HEART RICHARD YANG GANTENG ITU PUNYA PACAR\"\n\nPadahal jelas-jelas saya lebih ganteng begini.

Additionally it will propose a permanent inflation to GAS mining in the NEO ecosystem. With these changes it will provide a clearer seperation of concerns between NEO (the governing token) and GAS (the utility token), as well as better align the incentives between the NEO holders and consensus nodes.\n\n## Motivation\n\nLet us first consider three goals of the NEO network protocol\n\n**Goal 1:** Have network fees be low while being resistant to spam attack  \n**Goal 2:** Effectively reward consensus nodes while still aligning their interests with NEO holders/users  \n**Goal 3:** Encourage circulation and spending of GAS within the NEO ecosystem\n\n*From this point on, I will use NEO holders and NEO network users interchangeably, as functionally they are the same group of people*\n\nI have distilled these goals based on discussion located [here](https://github.com/neo-project/neo/issues/285) along with other discussions amongst the community.\n\nIn the current iteration of NEO, none of these goals are being properly met, but we can work towards achieving them in NEO 3.0.\n\nIn order to achieve these goals. I propose three necessary changes to the protocol.\n\n**Action 1:** Network fees are no longer distributed to consensus nodes, but instead NEO holders.  \n**Action 2:** GAS generation does not go to zero in twenty two years but instead asymptotically levels off to a fixed inflation rate  \n**Action 3:** Consensus nodes collect a percentage of mined gas indefinitely, instead of network fees\n\nI believe with these three implementation changes we will be able to effectively achieve the three goals that I have mentioned above.\n\n## Rationale\n\n### Low Network Fees and Spam\n\nCurrently the NEO network has 0 fees which makes it susceptible to apam. We have already seen spam attacks carried on the test network, and most recently on the main network as well. The natural solution to spam attacks is to \n\n* 1. Limit the number of free transactions per block\n* 2. Make users attach fees to their transactions attach fees to transactions\n\nThis will generally render spam useless or require the spammer to pay more and more money in order to continue his attack. The problem with this solution is that it HARMS NEO holders and HELPS consensus nodes.\n\nLet\u2019s consider an escalation in a fee war between a spammer and the users of the NEO network. As the fees gradually rise, the consensus nodes will continue to get more and more profits while the users of the network suffer. This creates a perverse incentive where the consensus nodes actually have an incentive to spam the network because they will collect all the fees associated with the spam.\n\nSo in the current iteration of Network fee implementation, consensus nodes and spammers prosper from high fees while users suffer.\n\nIf we adjust so that network fees are instead paid out to the NEO holders, then the spammer will be paying the network users to continue his spam attack. If the attacker\u2019s goal is to harm the NEO network paying large sums of money to the NEO holders is completely counter productive.\n\nUsers will effectively be subsidized in a fee war by the spammer, and although it maybe annoying is signficantly less harmful than the previous solution.\n\nThere is one big problem, in this scenario we have completely removed the incentives for consensus nodes entirely. We will disccuss how to adjust the model so that consensus nodes can still be rewarded in this system later.\n\nHowever, with this adjustment I believe we have achieved Goal 1, which is keeping network fees as low as possible while still being resistant to spam attacks.\n\n### Asymptotic Gas Inflation\n\nCurrently as stated in the whitepaper, gas generation is meant to bootstrap the network and distribute it amongst NEO holders, and while this is a good goal, it leads to many problems.\n\nIn this system GAS becomes a deflationary currency over time. This means it encourages the hoarding of GAS rather than the spending of GAS. We see this time and time again with crypto assets that try to be a \u201cmeans of transfer.\u201d\n\n**If something is meant to be used as good means of transfer (utility coin) as opposed to a store of value it SHOULD be inflationary.**\n\nGAS will not be able to fulfill its main purpose of utility if it is a deflationary currency.\n\nTo make matters worse, the deflationary nature of GAS is accelerated by not only lost GAS, but also by NEO black holes which continually accumulate GAS, and remove it from the system entirely. We can combat black holes by making sure that the amount of GAS lost to it always remains below the inflation rate. This makes the GAS supply more stable, and disincentivizes users from hoarding GAS. Encouraging users to spend GAS on network fees and system fees (as well as for purchases outside of the network) will, in the long run, be much more positive for the NEO ecosystem.\n\nWe are extremely lucky to be able to leverage the dual token model to have one asset be used as a store of value, and one asset to be used as a means of exchange. Deflation is good for a store of value, and inflation is good for a means of exchange.\n\nMaking GAS inflationary solidifies the use case and seperation for NEO and GAS instead of blurring the lines.\n\nSo by making GAS inflationary we have achieved Goal 3 which is encouraging use and spending of GAS in the NEO ecosystem.\n\n### Consensus Node Rewards\n\nWith inflationary gas we can now effectively reward consensus nodes without ever putting them in conflict with the users. Consensus nodes can now be rewarded with a fixed or percentage amount from the mined GAS, so that they are always incentivized to keep producing blacks, and the network stable because that is their only source of income.\n\nThey do not have to worry about any sorts of fees, and are encourage to maintain a passive role in the ecosystem. They will be encouraged to find the best ways to keep block times low, and network uptime very high which also benefits users. Thus we have achieved goal [\\#2](https://github.com/neo-project/neo/pull/2) of effectively incentivizing consensus nodes without having any conflict between them and the users.\n\nFinally running consensus nodes has as fixed cost associated with it. It should have a fixed reward as well\n\n## Specification\n\nThe main parameters we need to consider are the inflation rate, and the ratio of mined gas that is split between the consensus nodes and NEO holders. However more discussion is needed about the proposal at hand before these parameters can be considered", "@MericanHodl @rogerkver I think you may be wrong.

Ask Your Parents, to use an exchange like Kraken,(sorry Coinbase, not recommending you), and many other exchanges. They will usually use KYC regulations, and require your id or other documents.\n\n \n\n2. Use [LocalBitcoins.com](https://LocalBitcoins.com) or [Paxful.com](https://Paxful.com) . Psssh, who needs KYC, when you can buy BTC without it. It is not that simple however, LBC and Paxful, use an escrow service, meaning that the bitcoins the seller has and you need to give him your payment method, be it Paypal or gift cards, in time before the escrow expires. I have lots of trades on both of these sites, and to verify that the seller is good, you need to, have prior sales with him/her, or look at his/her's profile and see the positive and negative feedback. The fees on both of these sites are enormous, even if you are using small amounts. You can use many options to buy on both of these sites, including, ITunes gift cards, Xbox GC's, Prepaid Visa and Amex Cards, Paypal, Amazon Gift Cards and many more. Remember, if you have bitcoin sin the wallets of this website, amke sure to transfer it to your personal wallet or others, I'll get into that later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3.  Use r/Cash4Cash, and r/giftcardexchange. Well if you are reading this, better just stay here, on both of these subreddits you can trade prepaid gc's or just regular GCs for Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, or just straight up Paypal or Square Cash money. On these subreddits, you want to verify the user you are trading with, NEVER trade with low karma/throwaway accounts, and use r/GCXRep, and r/C4CRep, so you know other people are real and other people know you are real and not a scammer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. Work for it, Some places on the internet give you bitcoin for working for it, if you can do the tasks on these sites, however big or small, you can get BTC, like r/Jobs4Bitcoins, [Coinality.com](https://Coinality.com), [Cryptogrind.com](https://Cryptogrind.com), and r/slavelabour.\n\nYou might find out that some of the jobs might be too complex for you. But scroll a bit and you will find some easier ones.\n\nIf you want to use these freelance sites effectively, then try to up your typing skills, get better research skills, learn about graphic design, or if you are good at illustrations, use these to your advantages. r/Slavelabour is for extremely small tasks, that pay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. Storing your BTC effectively and privately. Remember the age old Bitcoin mantra, *Not your keys, Not your Bitcoin, Your Keys, Your Bitcoin*, this means that your private keys, which is the thing you need to access your wallet and sign transactions, you should be in control of, on all exchanges, like Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitfinex, you are not in control of your private keys, meaning that they can shut down your account for many reasons, or they can be hacked. This also applies to your 12 Word Seed or Mnemonic Phrase that you get when you open a wallet, KEEP IT SAFE, IF YOU LOSE EITHER OF THESE, YOUR BTC IS EFFECTIVELY LOST, read up on it more here  [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed\\_phrase](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase)\n\nand here  [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Private\\_key](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Private_key) , if you want to get the best wallets for storing your btc go here  [https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) , but my favorite one is Electrum personally. Although this is not on [bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org), I suggest Exodus wallet for multi-cryptocurrency support, if you are looking to invest in more. \n\nAnother danger you have to face is downloading btc wallets on malware infested computers, this will affect in your BTC being lost, so don't do it.\n\nThe worst way to store your bitcoins is on the internet, web wallets, like [Blockchain.info](https://Blockchain.info) where you are not in control of your keys, do the same things like exchanges mentioned before, where your wallets can be shut down and can, and, were hacked.\n\nThe two best ways to store your bitcoins are on Hardware wallets like [Trezor](https://trezor.io/), [Keepkey](https://shapeshift.io/keepkey/), and [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/), where your BTC is stored on physical hardware, the only downside is that it costs money, if your parents are cool with crypto, they probably will let you have one. If they are not, try to get one delivered to a friends house who consents, the Ledger in particular looks like any unsuspecting flash drive.  Make sure you are buying from the official websites of the wallets and not other ways, counterfeit Hardware wallets have security defects. The next best way, are paper wallets like on [bitaddress.com](https://bitaddress.com), where your bitcoin public key and private key are on paper and not on any computers, it is essential that you turn off WiFi on this site and make sure nobody is spying on you. Paper wallets have a problem that sort of defeats the purpose of using it that to to take out the funds you need to use a web wallet. But, still for people who want privacy in storing btc and at about zero cost(apart from ink and a working printer) ,it works.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n This applies to minors also, *Never Invest More than You Can Afford To Lose*, Don't put your entire allowance into BTC, if you are in it for the money, you will need to have patience. If you are not in it for the money, good job, you are about to venture into the world of cryptography and privacy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR: If you want to get BTC when underage, ask your parents, or use LBC/Paxful and trade Gift Cards, Go on job boards that pay in BTC, and store BTC in safe [Bitcoin.org](https://Bitcoin.org) sanctioned wallets.", "A Sad Joke: Bitcoin Cashs Lead Coder Quits Bitcoin Unlimited Project https://t.co/bkf4wXKZAk", "This Jesse Powell song make me sad but I can't just listen to it one time https://t.co/XQe9fcOQPp", "#Steem #STEEM is on its 30 days low, losing more than -38.11%.

All opinions are welcome, but they have to be presented in a constructive manner.

Big blocks work lets discuss why Bitcoin Cash has subcent fees and Lightning is always 18 months away.\n\nPersonally, I don't see why your first comment was moderated.  You didn't talk about Bitcoin or the block size cap being \"stupid\".  You only presented your opinion that high fees would drive away poor users and cited Samson Mow's comments on the matter.

XLM is 89% down from its ATH. By comparison, even projects I follow that have positive investor sentiment (NANO, VET, NEO) are closer to 95% down. Even WTC after a recent 300% increase is still nearly 95% down, and it\u2019s appareebtly being used on a wide scale. Yes, XLM can fall to 5 cents, but it was at 7 cents not too long ago. Always good to put things in the broader market context. \n\nWhat\u2019s getting people frustrated is that there seem to be only a couple projects that are chasing their ATH (BNB and to a lesser extent, BAT). This is a very small portion of the market. Most of the market is still very low. I\u2019d urge everyone to be patient. I remember putting a small investment in DENT not too long ago at 24 sats but quickly pulled out when I saw the pervasive negative sentiment on their sub. It continued to make new lows afterwards. Some people will look here to decide whether or not to buy XLM. \n\nI don\u2019t want this community to fall apart simply because people have problems with the token model and think it has affected the price. Maybe it has, but XLM has still performed very well since the beginning of 2017, compared with the rest of the market. It\u2019s easy to start questioning tokenomics when something like BNB has outperformed the whole market. \n\nXLM is still one of my favorite cryptocurrencies, and I still think it has a high chance of being used in the future (not that it will, but I\u2019m still supporting it). \n\n-Victor Cobra", "Bruised, but not broken: nChain CEO Jimmy Nguyen holds forth on Bitcoin SVs future @decryptmedia #Cryptocurrencies https://t.co/3NMtDneTfZ", "@julianhosp Who the hell want to change Buffets mind.

Otherwise, you don't need to do anything.\u201d\n\nu/Crypto_Economist42\n\n**Q: \u201cHow much will the yearly renewals cost?\u201d**\n\nA: \u201c$5/year for names that are 5 characters or longer, with higher prices for shorter names once they become available.\u201d\n\n**Q: \u201cHow will ENS team manage and spend the funds? Will there be a foundation or transparent oversight?\u201d**\n\nA: \u201cInitially, funds will be sent to the ENS root multisig, for the keyholders to determine how to allocate funds. We're considering other options for the long-term.\u201d\n\n**Q: \u201cWhat if ENS receives much more money than it needs to support ENS ? Will it donate the excess to the ethereum foundation ?\u201d**\n\nA: \u201cIt's ultimately up to the keyholders how to allocate funds, but we hope they will contribute them to other ecosystem projects in the event that the funds raised exceed those reasonably needed by the ENS ecosystem.\u201d\n\nu/Sfdao91\n\n**Q: \u201cDo you have an idea why mayor exchanges haven't implemented ens yet?\u201d**\n\nA: \u201cIn our interactions with exchanges, they're quite conservative about implementing things, particularly when it comes to systems that help only with one chain - even when that chain is Ethereum. We're working on them, but the best thing you can do is contact your exchanges and ask for ENS support, to show there's real demand from users.\u201d\n\nu/carlfarterson\n\n**Q: \u201cIs there official documentation for creating subdomains? What are the pros/cons for subdomains?\u201d**\n\nA: \u201cAll our docs are at [https://docs.ens.domains/](https://docs.ens.domains/) \\- see the 'Managing Names' and 'Writing a Registrar' sections for allocating subdomains. If you just want to create subdomains manually, you can use our manager tool at [https://manager.ens.domains/](https://manager.ens.domains/). Subdomains are easy to create and allocate, but your ownership of a subdomain is ultimately dependent on the owner of the parent domain letting you continue to own it.\u201d\n\nu/Ethan710\n\n**Q: \u201cGUI or command line to implement?\u201d**\n\nA: \u201c[https://manager.ens.domains/](https://manager.ens.domains/) is our graphical interface. There are a couple of CLI tools: [https://medium.com/@jgm.orinoco/an-ethereum-name-service-command-line-tool-2d2ec2e0ae29](https://medium.com/@jgm.orinoco/an-ethereum-name-service-command-line-tool-2d2ec2e0ae29) and [https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers-cli\u201d](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers-cli\u201d)\n\nu/rootsq\n\n**Q: \u201cAre the renewals for the domains be postponed? in my case I gotta do it this MAY 2\u201d**\n\nA: \u201cYou can transfer any existing domain any time between May 4, 2019 and May 4, 2020. You can renew any domain at any time.\u201d\n\n**Q: \u201cHow to renewal many ENS at once? so, you just spend Gas for one Tx to renew a lot ENS\u201d**\n\nA: \u201cOur UI supports individual renewals, but anyone can write an interface to renew names; see our docs at [https://docs.ens.domains/.\u201d](https://docs.ens.domains/.\u201d)\n\n**Q: \u201cWhere can I manage all my ENS? I want to see all my ENS on some webpage in a list... In my wallet broken down\u201d**\n\nA: \u201cENS Listing have an interface for this here: [https://enslisting.com/manage/home](https://enslisting.com/manage/home). We will be adding support for this in the near future to our manager app.\u201d\n\n**Q: \u201cWhat happens if I have several ENS and they need renewals in different dates but I want to renew all at once in one Tx, how can I do it?\u201d**\n\nA: \u201cYou can renew any existing name at any time.\u201d\n\n**Q: \u201cWhat happens if I already claim a domain, but in the Info. part says TTL:0, Is there any problem?\u201d**\n\nA: \u201cTTLs are an optional feature that allow you to specify to a resolver how long they can cache data for. It's safe to leave this as 0.\u201d\n\n**Q: \u201cCan I renewal a ENS for less than is Fixed? example: it was set for 1 eth, can I renewal for 0.01 Eth?\u201d**\n\nA: \u201cThe contract allows renewals of any duration, with a minimum of 28 days. Our interface only supports renewals in 1 year increments, for simplicity.\u201d\n\nu/matthiasdix\n\n**Q: \u201cCan I trade ENS-Domains on NFT-Exchanges or something like that?\u201d**\n\nA: \u201cOnce we've migrated to the new registrar, you'll be able to trade .eth domains as NFT tokens.\u201d\n\n**Q: \u201cHow can I transfer the \u2018new\u2019 domains to someone else?\u201d**\n\nA: \u201cYou will be able to do this using our manager interface at [https://manager.ens.domains/](https://manager.ens.domains/), or using any tool with NFT support.\u201d\n\n**Q: \u201cAre subdomains handled the same way as before? Any changes in subdomains?\u201d**\n\nA: \u201cOnly the registration and renewal process for .eth domains is changing. Resolution, and management of other names remains the same.\u201d\n\n**Q: \u201cWhat prohibits large scale domain grabbing besides yearly fee?\u201d**\n\nA: \u201cThe cost of doing this is the only limitation in place.\u201d\n\n**Q: \u201cHow does subscription renewal work?\u201d**\n\nA: \u201cAnyone can renew an existing name by paying the required fee. There's no 'subscription' mechanism, but you can renew a name for any duration you want.\u201d\n\n**Q: \u201cCan someone grab my domains at the end of my subscription period?\u201d**\n\nA: \u201cYou can renew at any time, so simply making sure you renew before the name expires will prevent this. There will also be a 'grace period' after your name expires, during which you can renew the name to retain ownership of it.\u201d\n\n**Q: \u201cWhat are the plans of promoting ENS for the \u2018average joe\u2019?\u201d**\n\nA: \u201cWe're working mostly on getting support in as many tools and products as possible, so that ENS becomes a natural choice for users.\u201d\n\n**Q: \u201cWould you do an interview with Ivan on tech or any other \u2018influencer\u2019?\u201d**\n\nA: \u201cWe're always happy to be on podcasts and other events!\u201d", "RT @AshokNellikar: #Fintech's &amp; #FinancialServices companies have a lot of #opportunity to target the low- to moderate-income #consumer &amp; t", "I actually kind-of like it, that there are still many people outside this community, thinking Vechain is a scam.

Here is Why - Today's Gazette - https://t.co/ox7dmJtFs5", "For those pay walled:\n\nThe newest enticement in the crypto world is something traditional investors know very well: interest payments.\n\nCoinbase, a platform where users can buy and sell bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, is launching a program for institutional investors that will pay them a set interest rate, likely between 5% and 8%, when they park money in its custody service. The program, called \u201cstaking,\u201d comes with a crypto twist. The interest is earned only if customers are holding certain cryptocurrencies, and the interest will be paid in those cryptocurrencies.\n\nCryptocurrencies [are in the dumps](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-is-in-the-dumps-spreading-gloom-over-crypto-world-11552927208?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1&mod=article_inline), with prices falling and trading volume shrinking, so Coinbase and other companies are looking for ways to expand their revenue base. Coinbase, which announced the new service Friday, plans to pitch the program as a way for investors to get a set return on notoriously volatile assets. For the crypto projects themselves, it is a way to attract new backers.\n\nStaking is based on a concept called proof of stake. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum are run by interconnected but independent computers. To become part of that network, users have to buy their way in. In exchange for that capital and computer power, however, they are promised a payout in newly created tokens proportionate to their investment. Coinbase\u2019s service will take those payouts and turn them into regular, recurring payments.\n\nProof of stake is less energy-intensive than [bitcoin\u2019s version](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-turns-10-still-not-all-grown-up-1540987201?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=7&mod=article_inline) of this concept, called proof of work. In that version, users are required to solve a complex math riddle, which becomes harder as more users participate. The computing power required to solve the puzzle creates the underlying value, which is why bitcoin is so energy-intensive.\n\nThe goal of both proof of stake and proof of work is to give people an incentive to participate in the network, thus ensuring it is sustained indefinitely. The strategies are also meant to protect networks from malicious actors.\n\nBecause of the difference between proof of stake and proof of work, bitcoin isn\u2019t an option for staking. Coinbase\u2019s staking service will start with only one cryptocurrency, called Tezos, which launched last year. Other cryptos will be added later.\n\nCoinbase is [the largest company](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coinbase-expands-with-deal-for-broker-dealer-keystone-capital-1528321468?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=20&mod=article_inline) in the sector to start offering this service. A startup called Staked offers a similar service, and another one was just launched by a company called Battlestar Capital. These services are essentially cooperatives using pooled capital for the staking service. Another startup, BlockFi, accepts cryptocurrencies as deposits for interest-bearing accounts and as collateral for loans.\n\n\u201cThe industry has to evolve from just holding these things to doing interesting stuff with them,\u201d said Sam McIngvale, head of product at Coinbase\u2019s custody division.\n\nCoinbase says its custody service, which launched last summer, has about $600 million in assets. Coinbase will split the staking revenue with customers, taking 20% of the newly minted cryptocurrency. The company is also exploring other ways to monetize assets in the custody service, such as collateralized lending.\n\nStaking is the next step in Coinbase\u2019s goal of expanding crypto-based financial services, and clients had been asking about it, Chief Executive Brian Armstrong said in an interview.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to build a new financial system,\u201d Mr. Armstrong said. \u201cTo do that, we need more and more people.\u201d", "EARN UP TO $50 !!! \nworth of STELLAR LUMENS $XLM\n...and do it while it's STILL LOW\n#LearnAndEarnCrypto!!\nStart le https://t.co/gNBEeg8Ldk", "The year was 2010... i was in my final year of school at st johns university, living in a small dorm with 2 guys. i would say march or april if i had to guess the month, early 2010 for sure. I was excessively told about bitcoin by my 2 of my college  roommates who spent too much time online and decided to do some of my own research, read the whitepaper made by satoshi n and was quite fascinated by the technology, i knew it was something new and ahead of the time, but also something that could terribly fail and be another fad. although, because of how much my 2 roomies talked about it i decided why not throw a bit of money into it, and was fine with losing it or not. so fast forward, i lived in new york and was able to find a local who actually sold bulks of bitcoin through my 2 friends who previously bought off them. i was a bored college student... didnt know what i was gonna end up doing with the coins. i wanted to buy $50 worth... ended up spending a bit more than that $60-$80 i believe to get exactly 10,000 bitcoins. it was given to me on a usb which was checked on his computer to verify the bitcoins were really there before i took off. everything was good and i transferred the file from the usb to my personal laptop. now, a single bitcoin was worth a fraction of a penny so i really did not have much focus on such a small thing (at the time). ever since i put it on my laptop i really just forgot about it and did not even think about any ways for me to spend it or use it etc. and just kept it stored on my laptop. i continued to forgot about it due to me graduating college being my primary focus and that's that. then after i graduated i looked to work and did work and never really even thought to care about some stupid bitcoin i bought off some guy for a bit of money. it was just another file on my computer i didnt bother to even look at for months on months.   \n\nNow fast forward to early 2014 --- this is when i first heard about bitcoin again since i bought em, and no i did not continue to hear from them from my two roommates i was with while in college as 2010 is the year i graduated and after that we did not keep in touch. although i would assume they either lost the bitcoin they had online or are rich as fuck right now, wont find out as i have no way to contact them. anyways, so i was hanging out with a friend of mine who mentioned it to me and how the price went to $1000 and was down a bit and it would be a good time to buy some because he thought it was the future of money, it took me a few minutes to process, then it hit me and i literally almost fainted after coming to the realization i was pretty sure i had a shit ton of what he was talking about. i didnt even fully remember whether i had 1,000, 10,000, 100,000 immediately because of how much it was and how long ago i bought it but i knew it was one of those. i was so shocked and he was so confused then i just left the conversation as soon as he told me about the price to go online and check for myself if this is really the same shit i bought 4 years ago as a curious college student. it all hit me at once, i knew by the symbol and the chart which showed it going from where i bought it at less than a penny all the way to over $1000 that this was exactly what i bought and i remembered i bought 10,000 with the $60-$80 i spent and was in disbelief and euphoria over the fact that i had an absolute huge fortune waiting for me at home. this all felt unreal to me, i still remember the emotions i had going through me. now after realizing i had this fortune, i had to remember carefully where i stored these bitcoins, eventually i remembered i had it on my old personal laptop and at that moment i had a panic attack due to the fact that the laptop i had put the bitcoin on broke on me and was replaced although i figured i am not totally doomed because all i should need to get the file is the hard drive. \n\nSo here I am at home, looking for the computer only to realize that because it was broken and old and damaged, my mom told me she had thrown it away a few years back after it broke down on me since she thought it was pretty much untouched junk and expected id never need it again. at that point i literally fainted, i was angry, confused, shocked, in denial, sad, raged and so many other emotions all at once that i literally just passed out. my mom woke me back up and i ran out of the house out of anger to go have a mental breakdown in my backyard. What was supposed to be the best day of my life become by far the worst. As u can imagine, the fact that i thought i had what was between 5-10 mil at the time and then right after had that taken away from me broke my heart. i never felt the amount of pain and severe depression i felt as i did on that day. the next few months of my life were spent very badly, every day i would be reminded of what happened and how my life could of been but wasnt because my mom threw out my fortune, i am not proud of it but i started to actually resent her and be disrespectful to her often. it was a bad bad time as i was working a shitty job with low pay and living in my parents house at 25 (shout out to my useless degree) so that bitcoin would have really changed my life completely. i started going through severe depression and suicidal thoughts constantly, i really did want to kill myself knowing what had happened to me. although i tried to get through it and didnt even tell any of my friends including the one who mentioned bitcoin to me to remind me of bitcoin what happened, though they felt i was acting different and not my usual self those following months. i barely went out, i lost my job due to my sudden lack of effort from what happened, i lost friends, i isolated myself from everyone and everything including my family. i gained a lot of weight and did a lot of dumb shit im not proud of. my life was pretty horrible for the year of 2014.  \n\n\nNow fast forward to early 2015 i started to get back on my feet and try to get over the shitty year i just had. and the fact bitcoin dipped to $200ish helped with how i felt about the whole thing, though i never even considered putting another penny in it again and hoped it would just crash and die so i could keep this in the past, although as u all know this wasnt the case. now here we are in 2019, i am still broke, i still live with my parents, i am employed, but at a shitty job i hate, and have friends, but we dont talk much, and life is just not the same as it used to be. Life just hasn\u2019t been the same since 2014. Seeing bitcoin go up insane amounts all the way to nearly 20k and now still thriving at around 5k really makes me sick to the stomach, to think that i bought 10,000 at less than a penny, WHAT THE FUCK... it still hurts. i really just want to feel like this is just some very long shitty ass nightmare and wake up to reality again but i know thats not the case. i could have had the most epic fucking life and most epic story to tell of how my riches came but it never happened. my life is on a downhill, i am severely depressed and just feel so shit everyday. things are not the same as they once were and never will be the same because bitcoin has ruined my life, or maybe i allowed it to ruin my life, idk. my hopes were all high and euphoric then right after low and dreadful within 24 hours, and it has impacted me til now and will continue to weigh me down for however much longer i live.  there is really no specific moral to this story, but i just wanted to vent this to someone or somewhere finally to get my story out. this is the first and last time i will speak out publicly to anyone about this, so there you guys go. that is the story of how i lost 10,000 bitcoin. that is all.\n\ntldr; college roommates convinced me to buy bitcoin back in 2010, i ended up buying 10,000 bitcoins for $60-80 and storing them on my laptop, forget about it until 2014 when my friend randomly mentions it hitting $1k and a good buying opportunity, i rush home to look for my old broken laptop which had the bitcoins on it in the hard drive to discover my mom threw it out and the bitcoins were gone forever, i become severely depressed and affected by this and til this day cant help but think what if i had those bitcoins. life sucks, fuck bitcoin, the end.", "This sucks because the roi of vet is already pretty low.

I understand that Central Banks are not allowing interest rates to increase due to 'low inflation'. Which is, low price inflation (CPI/basket of goods etc.)\n\nMy theory is that with current technological innovations (particularly automation/online price comparisons/smarter consumer base) prices are falling (if they are measured in terms of sound money like gold - or assets - in the sense that assets prices go up while the CPI basket prices are fairly static.\n\nTherefore, even though the CPI might be positive but low, the reality is real prices should be falling. The price falls in a sense are a kind of compensation to the general population  for automation and machine replacement.\n\nSo, can we say that although CPI is positive, but very low, actually price inflation rate is higher (in keeping with monetary inflation). E.g. If there is a natural fall in real prices, then any increase in CPI above the 'CPI adjusted for tech innovation' is the real rate of inflation. Rather than being 1%, it might be 5-6% (you could even work that out against a basket of asset prices).\n\nObviously, I need a better explanation of what I'm trying to express in my own lay thinking. Anyone can refer me to some good reading? Is there a technical word to describe 'the true inflation rate that is arrived at by adjusting for tech innovation deflation' that I'm trying to describe? \n\nPerhaps it's easier to just say setting rates using CPI as a measure is fallacious and central bankers should base it on monetary inflation? To say in this way seems fine to me, but in my mind, I want that link to price inflation, because I think they think they can get away with things as long as price tags in the shops don't change too much - we should understand and fight for the benefits/compensation of 'innovation deflation'. Or in other words, a sound currency that reflects the true value of things.", "#Salesforce #Blockchain brings low-code to trusted networks https://t.co/NKzRquvn7z @salesforce @jameswester @martha_bennett #lowcode", "RT @ynpad: Disregard bitfinex IEO, acquire $FSN\nthe future of crypto + banking is here fam; out with the old and in with new, lowkey #dab\n#", "I am low-key content today.\n\nBeing away from technology for 5 years now, being completely ignorant about latest inv https://t.co/HP96RPLWYZ", "@wavesplatform partners with @BlockpassOrg to bring fast and low-cost #KYC for #blockchain #businesses and #DApps https://t.co/H2D7iQYwmp", "RT @Djesfrey: @CryptoWendyO $APL is a truly unique blockchain like no other\n\nLow-cap, Undervalue, Great Potential, Amazing Community @Apoll", "SAD", "Remembering Gavin Kennedy (1940-2019): SAD to note the passing of Gavin Kennedy (1940-2019)  Scot Nat, iconoclast, https://t.co/PH0epoJw3H", "#Steem #STEEM #cryptocurrency just reached its 30 days low with value of $0.414905865456 - https://t.co/B6d9zN48py https://t.co/wNu2JJg4m9", "Indias Best-Funded Bitcoin Exchange is Running Low on Cash and Employees - On The Blockchain https://t.co/59RS7noKmT", "Blockchain enters the luxury spirits industry, initially through QR Scanning.

Both systems had been built following the guide [Raspibolt](https://github.com/Stadicus/guides/tree/master/raspibolt) and some parts of [Thundroid](https://github.com/Stadicus/guides/tree/master/thundroid) although I found that the last one was a little bit outdated. These guides are incredibly helpful for maintaning your node in these low-end machines. Thanks to Stadicus and the rest of contributors.\n\nI don't have much money on the node and closing all channels and reopening would had lead to lose perhaps 20-30% of all my Bitcoin in onchain fees. So I though of migrating from the Raspberry to the HC1 and see what happenned, as I have seen some vague descriptions on how to do it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8da6tn/transferring_lightning_node_to_different_computer/) and [here](https://gist.github.com/bretton/22f628caffde79390a796e75ea528053).  As the two systems, file paths, user names, OS, LND versions, etc are very similar if not identical, I decided to try it. I think it is critical to have the same LND version to migrate smoothly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSteps I followed: \n\n\\- I stopped lnd and Bitcoind in both systems : 'sudo systemctl stop lnd' and 'sudo systemctl stop bitcoind'\n\n\\- Ensured that they were successfully closed 'sudo systemctl status lnd/bitcoind'. I suppose that if there was some error during stop, it is good to start over the node and try to stop it again.\n\n\\- Used WinCSP to transfer the whole lnd folder from the RPi (in my case it was in /mnt/hdd/ and used the same tool to insert the folder on the HC1 in same location). In my case, I had already started on the HC1 an LND node without any channel, so I renamed the LND folder on the HC1 to be able to copy the new one. \n\n\\- Changed the ports 8333 and 9735 on the router to point on the HC1 instead of the RPi, although I think I could have simply assign the RPi IP address to the HC1.\n\n\\- Copied the tls certificate and macaron files as shown several times on the Stadicus guide, as \n\n    $ sudo cp /home/bitcoin/.lnd/tls.cert /home/admin/.lnd  \n    $ cd /home/bitcoin/  \n    $ sudo cp --parents .lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/admin.macaroon /home/admin/\n\n\\- I started Bitcoind. 'sudo systemctl start bitcoind' and waited to sync the chain 'bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo'\n\n\\-I started the LND node 'sudo systemctl start lnd'. The 'sudo journalctl -f -u lnd' showed that LND was waiting to be unlocked.\n\n\\- I used 'lncli unlock' (I read some people that it was better to use 'lncli create' and use the seed from the old node, but I think this doesn't work, or at least the channels will need to be closed anyway)  Using 'lncli unlock', I typed the password used on the RPi and voil\u00e0! LND successfully unlocked and everything works correctly.\n\n\\- I assume it is important to ensure that the old RPi node never tries to start LND. It can be done by deleting the files inside the lnd folder or changing the name.\n\nI didn't find anyone that had already done that. **I don't recommend to do it** if you have a lot of money, it is much safe to close all channels and transfer the funds to the new node and start over. For me, the risk was loosing maybe 30\u20ac.\n\nLeave your comments and don't be so hard on me...", "No. I predict other countries will come to regret letting speculation run absolutely rampant on speculative financi https://t.co/rMi2mdhpb7", "blockchain adds value in low (or zero...) trust + high transaction value settings\n\nblockchain enables the movement https://t.co/KR5Jf9m59j", "@CryptoCobain Still remember where I was when I heard.

Back then, Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cinflation\u201d (aka, the amount of BTC released onto the open market as a block reward) was 50 BTC every 10 minutes. Zcash is slightly different here in that a block reward happens every 2.5 minutes, thus the reward is actually 12.5 ZEC every 2.5 minutes (which is the same as 50 ZEC every 10 minutes. 2.5 min x 4= 10 min. 12.5 ZEC per block x 4= 50 ZEC).

In other words I'm not pro-BSV and I don't like CSW or CA however this delisting is setting a dangerous precedent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Binance's official motivation to delist BSV is bullshit. That exchange has no moral ground on which they can ask for BSV delisting as long as it has no issues listing all kind of scammy altcoins, not to mention running a Ponzi-lite scheme with Binance Coin (their execution is stellar but that coin should not be in top10 crypto).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPer CZ Binance's twitter on 12 Apr 2019: \"I normally don't like get involved in debates, pick sides, etc. But this is going too far. I also didn't like the fact that the fork caused BTC to drop below $6k, which caused pain to many in the industry.\" (source: [https://twitter.com/cz\\_binance/status/1116622696945602561](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1116622696945602561))\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasically Binance is punishing CSW, CA and BSV for the perceived damaged they did to BTC price value. I can only speculate but I think the moment was chosen based on BSV's reputation which is at an historic low thanks to CSW and CA retarded shenanigans.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Binance, shapeshift, blockchain, Gemini and others actions are abusive in nature and they betray a cartel mentality. As much as I don't like saying this, even a coin like BSV should be allowed to live or die based on its own merits. What Binance is doing is detrimental to the entire industry and it positions exchanges on a position of power: they can and will kill coins they don't like.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm just saying that before you celebrate this supposed \"victory of the community\" just think about the people which were gulible enough and bought BSV based on CSW and CA lies. Not all of them are BSV-shills and they are left without a way out, they will be ruined. Real lifes will be ruined because Binance found out about ethics ... when it suited their narrative.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. BSV price will fall but BSV will not die. Despite the concerted effort from all the exchanges, BSV will continue to linger in the background. \"And that's a good thing\" even for BCH. Exchanges killing coins at will is a scary prospect for the entire crypto-world. They are overstepping their responsibilities. The funny thing is that BSV might get vindicated at some point in the future :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. BCH is next. I have no doubt about it. If they are doing this to BSV which is actually quite insignificant compared to BTC then think about what they are preparing for BCH. Only in this context it's easy to understand Binance's obsession not to use the BCH ticker: they used BCC, BCHABC and BCHSV but they never used and they will never use BCH ticker because that would legitimize the BCH fork.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBottom line: Binance is a greater enemy to BCH than BSV will ever be.

What if demand for charity outpaces supply 100:1? And I agree that's something raw capitalism may not have an immediate answer for. That's why i've attempted to devise a system that may be able to patch this problem of social game theory and human psyche, both in re-incentivizing the good individuals as well as the selfish individuals, and any individuals in-between.\n\nFeel free to connect with me on your thoughts of this proposal, if you have any ideas for how I could put it into action faster, or if there's any specific caveats or nuances of the mechanism of action that it implements that you think need to be considered. If you are a developer or a capitalist that wants to contribute to this project, i'm 100% open to everything you could possibly throw at me. I'm much more focused on strengthening the utility case for Bitcoin Cash as well as the appeal of Voluntaryism than i am making money off of a good idea, and that is why i'm sharing this idea with you all to criticize and consider.\n\nHere is my proposal (please forgive any typos, as it's a long-sh piece that i've not done extensive spellchecking on): \n\nSmart Fundraisers: \nA system to fix the problem of market failure in charity\n\nThere is a great surplus of wealth in the world, but despite this surplus, and the otherwise manageable number of people in need of help, charity seems to always fall short of helping them completely. The system i'm proposing is a system that uses game theory to fix the problem of market failure in charity.\nThe number one reason people don't give to charity is that they believe that they do not have enough money, that their contribution would do more to hurt them then to help a cause. This problem can only be mended insofar as the individual has extra money to give at all. The second problem is the concept of fairness and individual significance. People get upset with the idea that they are likely the only one willing to donate, while everyone else sits on the sidelines because they themselves also feel insignificant. If a person knew that all that had to be done to reach a goal was for them specifically to donate some small amount, and that made the difference between a failed and a completed project, most people who considered the thought of donating to begin with would.\nThe last problem in charty, is the innate pull of selfishness. Even if we have the money, even if we know we can help, there's still one last thing pulling us back... inner greed and selfishness. Is it possible to incentivise the selfish to donate to charity? I think so. Imagine if some amount of collateral was put up in the circumstance that the project wasn't completed, and everyone who donated to the project which ended up failing would get their donations back, with guaranteed interest. If a selfish person thought that the project would fail, the selfish person might then take a risk and donate, for hopes of making interest off of it.\nMy system is a proposal to solve all of these problems and more, with a completed circle of incentives, so that there can be a market for charity.\nIncentive Structure of the Smart Fundraiser:\nEach fundraiser holds certain key properties.\n1) Guided metadata and description\n2) VAR: Collateral set\n3) VAR: Number of positions\n4) Size of positions\n5) VAR=3*4: Goal amount\n6) DYN VAR: Karma level\n7) VAR: Time limit\n8) Coin Shuffle integration\nEach smart fundraiser operates in a certain way. There is some number of quantified positions that must be filled for the SFC (Smart Fundraiser Contract) to be complete. A person can fill a partial or an excess of a position, however, the conditional refunding mechanism operates off of a trailing interest rate (firstcomers gets a sequentially higher proportion of interest). If the SFC is completed, the collateral and all filled positions is given to the fundraiser address, minus a fee of 2.5% which is surrendered to the network. If the SFC fails to meet the goal by the specified time limit, the collateral is used to subsidize the refunds of all those who participated, minus a 2.5% deduction on the collateral. There is also an opt-out \"forfeit rewards\" function, where a user can voluntarily choose to opt-out of a refund, so that no matter what, their money goes to the recipient.\nThe Trailing Interest Rate\n\nC= Collateral\nP= Positions\npN= Position Number (when you took a position)\nn= (C/P*1/P) \n\nSFC Interest Expression: ((C/P-(pN-1)*n)+(C/P-(pN-0)*n))\nSFC Interest Proof of Equation: (C/P-0n+C/P-1n)+(C/P-1n+C/P-2n)+(C/P-2n+C/P-3n)+(C/P-3n+C/P-4n)+(C/P-4n+C/P-5n)+(C/P-5n+C/P-6n)+(C/P-6n+C/P-7n)+(C/P-7n+C/P-8n)+(C/P-8n+C/P-9n)+(C/P-9n+C/P-10n) = C        \n\nExample 1:\nGiven: (C)Collateral=100\nGiven: (P)Positions=10 \nGiven: pN= 1\nn= (C/P*1/P) -> (100/10*1/10) -> 1\n\n((C/P-(pN-1)*n)+(C/P-(pN-0)*n))\n((100/10-(1-1)*1)+(100/10-(1-0)*1)\n((10-0*1)+(10-1*1))\n10+10-1\n20-1\n19\n\nThis Positiontaker will receive 19% of the collateral. This is equal to 19 units, or 190% of the position (10 units).\n\nThis is what the equation proof looks like:\n(100/10-0(1)+100/10-1(1))+(100/10-1(1)+100/10-2(1))+(100/10-2(1)+100/10-3(1))+(100/10-3(1)+100/10-4(1))+(100/10-4(1)+100/10-5(1))+(100/10-5(1)+100/10-6(1))+(100/10-6(1)+100/10-7(1))+(100/10-7(1)+100/10-8(1))+(100/10-8(1)+100/10-9(1))+(100/10-9(1)+100/10-10(1)) = 100        \n(10+9)+(9+8)+(8+7)+(7+6)+(6+5)+(5+4)+(4+3)+(3+2)+(2+1)+(1+0) =100\n19+17+15+13+11+9+7+5+3+1 =100\n100=100\n\nExample 2: Let's use some weirder numbers, just to make sure the formula is valid.\nGiven: C= 12345\nGiven: P= 4\nn= (C/P*1/P) -> 3086.25*0.25 -> 771.5625\n((C/P-(pN-1)*n)+(C/P-(pN-0)*n))\n((12345/4-(1-1)*771.5625)+(12345/4-(1-0)*771.5625))+((12345/4-(2-1)*771.5625)+(12345/4-(2-0)*771.5625))+((12345/4-(3-1)*771.5625)+(12345/4-(3-0)*771.5625))+  ((12345/4-(4-1)*771.5625)+(12345/4-(4-0)*771.5625)) = 12345\n(3086.25-0+3086.25-771.5625)+(3086.25-771.5625+3086.25-1543.15)+(3086.25-1543.15+3086.25-2314.6875)+(3086.25-2314.6875+3086.25-3086.25) = 12345\n12345 = 12345 \n\nOf course, these collateral amounts are highly disproportionate to the number of available positions. Either this would equate to poor marketing as a result of the asked amount being too high, or trying to incentivise people to participate past the necessary amount to incentivise them. Realistically, given a Fundraiser goal of 1000, you would be more likely to put 10 up as collateral with 100 positions, instead of putting up 100 for 10 positions (a person partcipating in the latter could almost double their investment, which is slightly ridiculous). With this mechanism of rewarding the firstcomers of a failed SFC, it incentivises people to participate immediately, as opposed to the normal action of \"waiting to see where it goes, then deciding after you've thought it through\". Those that act fast without second thinking pitching in too much are more likely to get rewarded highly for a failed SFC.\n\nGuided Metadata and Description\n\nEach smart fundraiser starts off by asking the fundraiser-starter some basic questions about the nature of the fundraiser, including proof of the claims made therein. Each fundraiser requires or asks for a body of text, a picture of the person making the fundraiser, pictures of relevant documents and/or bodily injuries, contact information for the individual, and/or a video of the person explaining the problem. After submission, the fundraiser is not allowed to be changed, and cancelling the fundraiser deducts 2.5% from the set collateral.\n\nFour Phases of Execution\n\nEach SFC exists in four separate stages. The time limits for each one is adjusted by the person creating the SFC, but a default setting might look like six hours for the first, six hours for the second, three days for the third, and a week for the fourth.\nPhase One: Community Review- In Phase One, members of the Smart Charity Community (SCC) will be incentivised to participate in contract review. Each SFC will have a small list of requirements, and members of the SCC will vote positive or negative on the satisfaction of these requirements (which is revealed to the SFC starter before creating the SFC). Different members of the community may hold a different voting weight, determined by how much Karma they have. Voting weight is determined by the decimal magnitude of your Karma.  A person with 1 karma would have a VW of 1, a person with 10 Karma would have a VW of 2, a person with 100 Karma would have a VW of 3, and so on. A person with -10 Karma would have a VW of 0.1, a person with -100 karma would have a VW of 0.01, and so on. With this voting weight, a person recieves or loses a karma point every time they vote on objective admissions. If a person votes in favor of the majority on an objective admission, they gain points based on the level of VW they have. If they vote against the majority, they'll lose that point instead. There are also a few subjective admissions, where a person recieves a karma point for voting no matter what (based on VW).\nThe overall points gained or lost in the review phase will carry over to the next three phases as an immutable part of the contract. It will also add to or subtract the karma of the individual's account after the contract is completed. But this is not the only time voting on this SCF is allowed, in fact, it is allowed in all four phases. There is a sentiment vote where every individual regardless of karma or VW gets to vote positive or negative on a SFC. Phase two voting is allowed and is added as a second layer to the already existing total, in Phase three voting is also allowed with the same parameters, and in the final phase each vote is given a weight of ten multiplied by VW. Karma is altered after the fact.\nQuestions that might be asked in phase one of each member of the SCC might be as follows:\n1) OA: Is the SFC coherent and legible?\n2) OA: Is the SFC about helping someone in need?\n3) OA: Is there a clear picture of the individual holding up a piece of paper that lists the date, name of his project, and his name?\n4) OA: Was some form of contact information given at the start?\n5) OA: If documentation or proof of injury is relevant, are pictures of such provided?\n6) SA: Do you personally feel like this project is good/necessary?\n\nPhase Two: Investor Speculation- This phase is set aside to reinforce the collateral of a SFC by incentivising people to invest in a project. The way it works is simple, a person stakes some money as reinforcing collateral, and if the SFC succeeds, all the investors get a proportional chunk of 50% of the 2.5% (or variably altered) fee as well as a refund on their money. If one person puts in $10 and another puts in $5, and that was all that was invested, the person that put in $10 would get 2/3rds of the halved fee. The consequence is that if the SFC fails, then their investment is mixed in with the collateral and redistributed to the positiontakers. The purpose for this phase is to help people that have little to no money for setting aside collateral, and obviously this would be a problem for many. Higher SFC fees on a SFC incentivise investors to come in. It is in the investor's best interest to choose good projects that will succeed, as anything else could hurt them via failure.\n\nPhase Three: Contract Execution- This is the phase where people can actually donate to SFC (and speculate on them if they may). Each SFC has a goal, a certain number of positions, and a size for each position, as well as collateral, a karmic disposition, and a predefined time limit.  All of the details and metadata of the project is included for everyone to see, and people are free to send their bitcoin cash to the address provided. All funds are sent through a coinmixing service so that the blockexplorers cannot be used to cheat on the speculative aspect of the fundraisers. You're free to fill partial or excessive positions, but partial positions do not qualify for a potential refund, and if the excess doesn't fill a whole new position, it is not refunded either. Also, partial positiontakings are calculated at the end of a SFC (as opposed to their chronological appearance on the blockchain), and any extra is kept with the SFC. As soon as a SFC is completed, it will finish Phase Three immediately and leave to Phase Four. Its still physically possible to donate to the fundraisers, but they won't appear on the site where you'd normally find them. Donating more to the fundraisers would just redirect the funds to the owner of the fundraiser directly.\nIf a SFC has a net-negative Karma after the time limit or position limit is reached, all the funds sent therein will be seized and absorbed as if it were completely consumed by fees on all fronts. This disincentivises investing in scams for hopes of speculating on and scamming scammers, and disincentivises scammers because they will lose their collateral even if they would have otherwise been successful. It also forces projects to be clean, legible, and as professional as possible.\n\nPhase Four: Communty Follow-Up Review- After a SFC is finished, the individual that started it is given a window of time to use their funds to do whatever they said they were going to do with them. After that prespecified time limit is met, the postexecuted SFC shows up again in the P4 column of the site and awaits the added metadata. The individual will be notified via email and address dusting to remember to add the metadata before the time limit is up. After the time limit is up, people are allowed to upvote or downvote the postexecuted SFCs. If a SFC turned out to be a scam or dishonest and unprevented effort, the user can be punished with bad karma. On the contrary, wholesome results will lead to positive karma, which has financial benefits.\n\nKarma and Economy\n\nThere is a built-in economy on Smart Charity. At the end of every month, a 0.2083% compound inflation (2.5% annual) of all SCC coins are distributed to the members of the community proportionally, based on net karma. At the end of every week, the revenue of the Smart Charity site is distributed proportionally to every SCC coin holder. This is 100% of the revenue, and doesn't have any other built in fees (besides the fact that the creators of the site may have a relatively large percentage of the coins in holding). Over time profit distribution will become more fair and decentralized.\nThe fees on the SFCs start off as 2.5%, but the user can actually raise or lower these fees to their complete preference. Higher fees incentivise investors and put your SFC at the top of the site, lower fees could bury or even hide your SFC from normal view. The fees will always be a market phenomemon and there are no forced fees to be extracted from any charity efforts. Except there is a consistent 2.5% on all collateral surrendered to the positiontakers of a failed SFC. Failed SFCs are still viewable to people to be invested in, but go in their own column away from the active ones.\n\nAdditional features:\n\nThere will eventually be a feature where you can send funds, and the Smart Fundraiser protocol will automatically and randomly donate to various projects based on a combination of Karma and low investment flow. It will also let you split up money multiple ways. The funds sent are nonrefundable. \nIn addition to the former, there will eventually be a feature to log one of your bitcoin wallets and extract a percentage of all recieved funds to donate to random projects. The percentage would be set to whatever you wanted it to be. This would custodialize and lower the security of your bitcoin wallet, however.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe this protocol would effectively lessen the scope of the market failure problem of charity, and possibly even eliminate it with enough monetary volume. People who gamble all their money away don't usually give to charity, and these kind of people will be drawn into the SCC to try to make money off of the poorer and less popular ends of all the projects, resulting in some instances where selfish individuals and gamblers actually serve to benefit someone in need. The rigid structure and mechanism of the protocol will also help spot and eliminate scams sent into the ecosystem, and ensure a productive healthy environment for everybody in it. \n\n\n", "high fees on btc core are great for both btc and bch.  change my mind!  the high fees are good for btc because its best case story is growing to a reserve currency and transparent notary layer.  even if it gets to 500$ / transaction that won't matter if it is being used by central banks / pension / endowment to move reserves and as a secure notary layer for data timestamp and verification of origination date.\n\nit opens the door for bch to step into the uncensored peer to peer cash use case with low fees and take over that role.  i can't really see lightning network in its current form satisfying the demand for low transaction costs for a layman (or providing a solution for the worldwide poor population who might only have a small amount of savings).  \n\nboth can exist and succeed at the same time and it's better for each to follow their own path and fulfill 2 different use cases.", "The most popular electronic money usage and its applications suffer from high volatility, high cost and low speed, https://t.co/nBQK0C0Dzm", "Sign Dzingel and Donskoi.

Hes busy, owes me nothing, and it probably wouldnt be good for him to endorse or bash a particular coin to somebody he doesn't know at all.\n\nHello Andreas - I have read your books the internet of money and mastering Bitcoin. I am urologist so I did not follow all of Mastering BTC, but I did get the main points. I have been reading, following, and using BTC for about 9 months now.\n\nHere on Twitter there is so much deception within the community. I have a question and honestly do not know of a good source other than you because people are so attached to their own coin.\n\nHere is my concern/question: I have been primarily investing in and using BTC and think the coin meets your 5 criteria you laid out in the \u201cblockchain or bullshit\u201d talk from South Africa. The security and Store of value is untouchable. 2nd layer scaling looks promising. But BCH seems to provide the alternative which is on chain scaling. I suspect a few coins will emerge with good use cases over the next decade. It seems like BCH meets your 5 criteria as well with the only concern being the centralization issue - which could change with time. As I think about this issue...it doesn\u2019t seem wrong to support, use, and invest in both? Litecoin, I guess, presents another option for on chain scaling? I only have used and invested in BTC...bought a small amount of LTC once but converted it. I read about BTC, BCH, ethereum and litecoin. I do not have time to research the other coins. I approach you with this because it is hard to find a reliable source in this space. I do not trust some of the people promoting BCH...but do think Roger Ver makes great points.... If you have time to answer/comment I will not take your response as investment advice and would never, under any circumstance, make your response public or known to anybody other than me.... I have posted this issue on my Twitter but got no responses because low followers.. Have a wonderful day. Thanks for all you do in the crypto space and elsewhere.\n\nI know this is old news for most of you guys. The \"scaling\" debate. I have watched Roger Ver debate so many people and to be honest, he always wins. His points are solid. \"Do you want to be able to buy coffee with bitcoin?\" He goes on and on. He tweeted today about making the fees so high as to drive people off chain, etc.\n\nWhen I got into crypto I did my research, did the reading and continue to do so. One person, early on...said \"never buy BCH. Some \"newbs\" make this mistake. So I have been against it from day 1, but cant help but think to myself that maybe BCH has a role. Maybe it will be a coin to emerge from the pack.\n\nHelp me understand. What am I missing?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I own NO BCH. I am not trolling the BTC forum. I consider myself a BTC maximalist at this point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE 1: SHOCKED. [r/BITCOIN](https://www.reddit.com/r/BITCOIN) BANNED THIS POST.

Of course I had never bothered to read Satoshi\u2019s white paper, describing the technology, before making that judgement. Had I made the effort to read the revolutionary paper released just a year earlier describing the blockchain, I would like to think that even that wet behind the ears, aspiring accountant would\u2019ve seen the genius behind it.\u00a0\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until a conversation with a colleague in September 2017 telling me about the book he was fixated on, \u201cBlockchain Revolution\u201d and that he had purchased one of these \u201cinternet coins\u201d did I first look into cryptocurrency myself. I knew very little about the space at this stage, however, the return on investment from what I understood was insane! How could I not make at least a small investment?\u00a0\n\nNow this was the later stage of the crypto bubble and I had started dabbling with investing in crypto with the easiest app to trade I could find on my iPhone, Fortune 500. Little did I know that I wasn\u2019t actually purchasing any cryptocurrency but merely entering into very short term futures contracts. Such an embarrassing oversight for any investor to make, let alone someone with a background in finance. Even so I didn\u2019t care, all I saw was that I was placing $500 in the app before bed and woke up with a value of $1300 the next morning! This happened several times (to nearly that extent)! It turned out that these temporary contracts ended up being a blessing in disguise, as almost overnight the long lasting bull run had ended. The people who held on to their crypto would be in for a long period of dramatically declining values.\u00a0\n\nThe mass exodus of investors and interest in the space was drastic. It seemed to all go out the door even quicker than it came. However, this didn\u2019t douse my interest in the space, in fact where others just saw an opportunity to make a quick buck and bail, I saw an opportunity to learn while others were disinterested. To invest when others were desperately selling. In late 2017 I was certain that cryptocurrency would be the future of money; but it also seemed that the ship had sailed for anyone to enter and make an impact as well as prosper in this space, while seemingly everyone was jumping on board. Despite all the doom and gloom that 2018 presented for investors and the negative sentiment some have with this relatively new space, I\u2019m more confident than ever that the advent of currency utilising blockchain technology back in 2009 opened up pandoras box. Cryptocurrency is definitely here to stay and I want to be heavily involved in the space while the opportunities of being an early adopter still exist!", "Hey all, GoodShibe here.\n\nJust wanted to throw a quick heads up and some best practices out there for people who are looking to buy and sell Dogecoin directly.\n\nPlease, please, please before you do any buying or selling go have a good look at /r/DogecoinScamWatch. Look at all the cases of people who either didn't know or knew better but didn't follow proper safety protocols. Speaking as someone who has, themselves, been scammed in the past it was my need to 'rush' things that screwed me over. And I definitely know better, lol. \n\nSo, if you're looking to buy/sell Dogecoin directly, please keep this most important piece of advice in mind:\n\nGo slow. Dogecoin moves fast so you don't have to. If you're selling $100 in Doge, do it in 20 x $5 transactions. Get payment, send DOGE, or vice versa. The person initiating the trade goes first. For instance: if you make an open post about wanting to buy/sell, the person who responds is initiating the trade, they go first. If you approach someone directly about wanting to trade with them, you're the initiator, you go first.\n\nOne of the most common ways a user gets scammed here is that they say they're suddenly in a rush or have to go, they'll often ask you if you can just send a couple big trades instead. Guess what usually happens next? Again, go look at /r/DogecoinScamWatch and you'll see this and more.\n\nOnce your DOGE is sent it is no longer yours and cannot be recovered. A modicum of patience and research will save you a lot of heartache.\n\nTo find out more about common scams and how to avoid them, please check out our Wiki:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Dogecoinscamwatch/wiki/index\n\nMuch Love,\n\nGoodShibe", "Looking for fresh alt coins to buy low?

While this redundancy is extremely wasteful, \u201emining speed\u201c equals to available hashing power and thus for a large part to energy costs. \n\nOutsourcing this incentivised task to third party miners, as history shows, therefore leads to formation of oligopolies or in worst case to monopolies, threatening the basis of decentralisation: if one or more colluding entities, due to concentration of hashing power, reaches 51% percent of the former, they own the \u201emajority vote\u201c and essentially could introduce falsified data into the chain (for example double spends). \n\nSo in essence, miner-based systems are wasteful due to redundant calculations and by design face centralisation issues due to incentivation of the work being done. \n\nAnother major issue is the segregation of users and miners. While users want their transactions to be processed swiftly at low fees, miners are in the game to make money. Their best interest are high fees and low transaction throughput to encourage high fees. \n\nThe most prominent example of this design failure due to this segregation is BTC: the limit of transactions that can be fit into a block is extremely limited to 5 - 7 tx per second. If users want their tx to be processed in the next block, they need to outbid other users by offering miners a higher fee than others. In late 2017 fees reached a peak of ~50$ per transaction  \n\nIn the last 10 years there have been dozens of attempts to increase the throughout of the network, to ease the need to offer higher fees. The mining cartel, making up the network, rejected these improvements, leading to several forks of BTC. \n\nIOTAs principle of each new transaction confirming two random previous transactions circumvents all the above mentioned challenges at zero fees while theoretically being infinitely scalable by design. \n\nFor businesses, in turn, this means that transactions are guaranteed to be processed at no fees: \n\nThere are no fees or bidding of higher fees to encourage a third party to include an important transaction into the next block, making the total cost of conducting business predictable. \n\nIOTA also makes business models relying on quick processing of transactions reliable, as issuers of transactions don\u2019t have to wait for a gracious miner to pick up one of their transactions for which they maybe can\u2019t offer a high fee (because it e.g. might not be economically viable to them).\n\nIn turn, a zero-fee system like IOTA enables low value assets to be sold. A 50 cent transaction fee might be economically viable for assets worth more than 50 cents but excludes any assets worth less. A 2 cent transaction fee might be economically viable for assets worth more than 2 cents but excludes anything worth less than 2 cents. If you follow that trajectory and ask yourself how high a fee could/should be, you automatically define which assets or business models are viable on a given platform. IOTA\u2019s enables businesses to sell any assets worth at least a millionth of a cent (that\u2019s its lowest denomination).\n\nSo, to answer your core questions:\n\n> Why should people secure the network\u00a0IF THERE IS NO REWARD FOR THEM?\n\nThe reward of validating transactions in IOTA is to be able reliably to conduct business at predictable cost (zero). See it as a \u201cforward payment\u201d. In validating two previous transactions on their own, business can rely on following transactions to validate theirs. If you are interest in the mathematical basis, look up \u201cgame theory\u201d. \n\n> ''Because it's feeless...''\u00a0you can say. But who cares?\n\nSee paragraph above explaining validity of business models and the exclusion of assets lower than the transaction fee required to conduct business. This comes down to your believe on whether \u201cuntapped\u201d assets at micro-level (for example data) exist or will exist in the future.\n\n> there are so many alternatives, Litecoin, Lightning network on Bitcoin, to pay just few cents on transactions\n\nBusinesses like to make a profit. Transactions fees are naturally conflictive to that, especially when it comes to fees that aren\u2019t fixed but prone to volatility due to the underlying token and its fluctuating monetary value.\n\nPredictions range between 20 and 150 billion IoT devices in just a handful of years. Let\u2019s do some basic math and be extremely conservative:\n\nImagine a future with just 20 billion devices of which only 0.2% of them transact on a DLT only once every 60 minutes. That would compound to 11,000 tps, resulting in 346,896,000,000 tx/anno (346.9 billion tx).\n\nLet\u2019s illustrate to what the low transaction fees would amount for Litecoin. To be fair, i am using an arbitrary date to calculate the fee; in this case December 26th, 2018at which Litecoin fees were $0.0253.\n\nFor our assumption of just 20 billion devices of which only 0.2% of them transact on a DLT only once every 60 minutes, this would compound into $8,776,468,800 (8.7 bn) in fees. \n\nLet\u2019s see what happens if we apply a more progressive future: the median of 75 billion devices but only 1.6% of them using a DLT every 5 minutes, compound to 4,000,000 tps, resulting in 126,144,000,000,000 annually (126.1 trillion tx) = $3,191,443,200,000.\n\nTo put that into perspective: 3.1 trillion USD amounts to 16.54% of the annual GDP of the United States, or ~4% of the worldwide GDP (GWP). So at only 10% of the median of expected devices transacting on a DLT every 5 minutes, the annual GDP of one of the worlds largest economy (USA) would have been passed in transaction fees alone. Crypto investors most likely don't like to hear that, but this future seems rather unlikely to me.\n\nSo, while there it is currently unknown whether transacting on DLTs instead of centralized systems amounts to any added value, transacting on them would amount to incredible added cost to society. If there\u2019s an alternative that costs nothing while enabling new business models that weren't viable previously, it\u2019s rather likely this alternative would be used instead. IOTA might work out to be one of these alternatives.\n\n> It seems obvious to me that if Iota wants to be used, he must find a better way to secure its network.\n\nCorrect. Contrary to some other platforms claiming production readyness, IOTA doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s not done.

I'm your host, Chronos, and today I want to give my thoughts on the recent drama around Bitcoin SV, a fork of Bitcoin Cash. Recently, the CEO of the major exchange Binance announced they are delisting the coin, as its founder, Craig Wright, threatens bitcoiners and generally acts like a bully on social media. Following suit, both Shapeshift and Kraken, two other large exchanges, have also announced they will delist it, and all this drama has caused the price of Bitcoin SV to crash by about 15%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have two thoughts on this. First of all, the fact that a coin can be so damaged by a handful of exchanges like this is not good. The blockchain is all about decentralization, so the more power these centralized exchanges have, the more the entire industry is at risk. I really hope we can distribute this power in the future by using decentralized exchanges that run on the blockchain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecond, the price crash has Bitcoin SV trading at just over 1% of the price of bitcoin, and that's a dangerously low price. Why is this dangerous? Well, Bitcoin SV uses the same mining algorithm as Bitcoin, so miners can actually just switch back and forth at any time. This means that if just one or two percent of bitcoin miners decide to switch to SV, they will probably be able to overwhelm its other miners and perform a 51% attack that lets them reverse recent transactions. This puts any exchange that still trades Bitcoin SV at risk, as their deposits could be reversed by an attacker.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDue to this weak security, it looks to me like the future is not bright for Bitcoin SV.

Antonopoulos on #Facecoin: #Facebook can't compete with #crypto\n\nFamed #Bitcoin influencer and author of Mastering Bitcoin, Andreas Antonopoulos, spoke on Facebook's imminent foray into #cryptocurrency and his thoughts on the implications of Facebook coin and what it could mean for the industry\u2026\n\nThe highly maligned Facebook crypto venture mostly divides the crypto community, with one halve suggesting that Facebook can help propagate cryptocurrencies, and the other believing that the firm could end up being highly detrimental to the industry.\n\nAntonopoulos fits, for the most part, into the latter halve, explaining on his YouTube channel during a Q&A several reasons as to why Facebook coin is essentially a soulless cash grab which looks to do more harm than good.\n\nThe influencer believes that Facebook coin would be little more than an alternative to Paypal as it would still have to comply with banking regulations, as well as Know your customer (KYC) policies:\n\n\u201cFacebook will not produce a coin that is censorship resistant, open, decentralized, neutral, or borderless. It will not be similar to any cryptocurrency. They will recreate the world of digital dollars, just like PayPal and Venmo, etc. \u2026 They will be competing against other banks.\u201d\n\nAntonopoulos also relayed that in his opinion, corporate cryptocurrencies such as Facebook Coin and JPM Coin can\u2019t, and won\u2019t compete against cryptocurrencies:\n\n\u201cThe differentiator for #cryptocurrencies is freedom. Open, neutral, #decentralized, borderless, and censorship-resistant money for the entire world, without discrimination, identification, or control. None of those features can be offered by these coins.\u201d\n\nDue to these reasons, the influencer believes that Facebook coin won't actually help anyone, certainly not those under authoritarian regimes or within economic crises:\n\n\u201cGuess what? About 90% percent of the human population lives under [or close to] those conditions. For them, \u2018#FaceCoin\u2019 isn\u2019t a solution. It is simply another broken, centralized currency. Open systems are the solution; the problem is caused by centralization of control. That problem cannot and will never be solved by \u2018FaceCoin.'\u201d\n\nAntonopoulos relay\u2019s that much of the issues plaguing Facebook, such as privacy and the firm's nonchalant attitude towards user data and the sale of such, will be transmitted into their crypto venture as well:\n\n\u201cThey will apply surveillance to all of your transactions, selling that data to hundreds of various\u2026 commercial companies and intelligence agencies, totalitarian regimes and [entities] like that. Facebook will sell the financial [data] of dissidents to the dictators hunting them down and get people killed.

What the hell!?\n\nSo now I'm wondering, where would be my best bet for easy, quick bank transfers without a huge wait time like on Coinbase. I want to invest SOON, not 2+ weeks from now. And it's just annoying that this kind of limit is put on users of Coinbase.\n\nMy next option would be to use a bitcoin atm, but some charge close to 20% fees!

There needs to be a pretty serious overhaul to meaningfully promise security to high throughput applications. For enterprise use cardano can offer same or higher scalable application infastructure but more interoptable and also more secure. \n\nethereum layer 2 solutions actually threaten the value of ether right now. On cardano the architecture ensures ADA will be far more stable overall in how its value is tethered to more aspects of the settlement layer that side chains depend on. Ethereum has pretty poor price control measures on its currency and so it is difficult to build applications without knowing how the price will fluctuate as well. They throw darts and change gas costs, but what happens when people don't really need to use gas much if at all with one-way transfers onto side chains. Do they just charge silly costs for low utility value propositions to be a part of ethereum but seperate? Taxation without representation basically. \n\nThe way Cardano works enables better privacy and security at scale, ethereum as both a settlement and computation layer is a incontractable problem currently without violating core aspects of what actually makes a blockchain a blockchain. The value proposition the settlement layer and nodes on such provide for the computation layer is far greater for Cardano and so utility and price of ADA can be well controlled and justified. \n\nIn general ethereum is a proof of concept that works for small scale projects but can't support serious killer applications that derive from the security and control at scale Cardano can provide.

The launch of the Peyman comes amidst speculation that Iran is developing its own state-backed cryptocurrency.\n\nDue to economic sanctions imposed by the United States, Iran\u2019s ability to conduct business internationally has been crippled \ud83c\udd98. Last year, Iran identified cryptocurrencies as a means to circumvent the sanctions.\n\nThe introduction of the Peyman also comes directly after Iran\u2019s central bank issued new cryptocurrency regulations. While there are still restrictions on Bitcoin, Iran gave the green light to ICO\u2019s, exchanges, wallets, and cryptocurrency mining.\n\nThis development is not surprising to our team. One of the most important value propositions of this space is the accessibility to censorship resistance money. This could reshape the effectiveness of economic sanctions imposed by the world\u2019s elite nations as smaller nation states resort to using cryptocurrency and blockchain to remain relevant on the international economic scene.", "Another dark day in human history. @binance hack today pinpoints the dirty greedy and low nature of the #HomoSapien https://t.co/9fGMa4zA2X", "@notgrubles Bitcoin Cash remains the real Bitcoin, no matter how much the low-throughput, settlement-layer BTCers may dislike it.", "RT @idanneeman: FairCoin - The most eco-friendly cryptocurrency!\nVery low power consumption for checking transactions.\nRead more: https://t", "Canadian Province Offers Low-Cost Energy Incentives to Bitcoin Miners via Bitcoin Magazine #Cryptocurrency https://t.co/9ebbHV9XJi", " Get instant access to the most #trending markets to invest in with your #Bancontact at low costs and trade at 0% https://t.co/TWEnAbGdwl", "Just got told that #Bitcoin will fail but blockchain tech will succeed.

Now the big question is, HOW did they suppress the price.\u00a0\n1) Did they short XRP' on multiple exchanges, meaning they have a big bag of short positions there that need to be closed (bought back eventually).\u00a0\n2) Or is XRP' just like\u00a0[Bitcoin\u00a0](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/). That the future price of Bitmex XBT' is the big boss in the market and that everything follows the future price. Normally what whales/pro's do when they have big positions that need to be closed. They use retail money to do this. They simply push through a big resistance/support zone, so stops get triggered and a big buy/sell wave happens that goes in to their buy/sell order.

Also notice that at the end of that chart, the subsidy is still producing ~0.58 DCR per block.  The next reduction interval it will be ~0.576 DCR, then ~0.569 DCR the interval after that, and so on.  The result is a very long tail of super low and continuously waning non-compounding inflation per year to continue facilitating a gradual decrease of subsidy as opposed to an abrupt end.\n\nIf you're interested in comparing total supply by year during the larger inflation years, I made a post a while ago that compares the estimated total supply between Decred and Bitcoin on a yearly basis along with a chart that graphically compares the emission curves between the two as well [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/78hzyl/yearly_comparison_of_decred_and_bitcoin_estimated).", "Important\nBack to Basics: What Is #Money?\n\nWho Controls Fiat Money?\nThe Great Depression and Bank Runs\n\nThe Intern https://t.co/omyWL7OtDT", "RT @bradentbh: Jimmy Fallon participating in laughing about a joke about Taylor Swifts body after she went on his show and performed a sad", "RT @Crex_24: Dead coins delisting.\n\nWe're working on a \"dead coins delisting service\".\nHolders of dead coins (coins with broken blockchain)", "The price of bitcoin has broken above $10,000 (7,855) for the first time since March 2018, as the cryptocurrency's https://t.co/vmeWb6Urvf", "@jaimenm Eight is an obvious exaggeration.

Here's the abstract:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*While several consensus algorithms exist for the Byzantine Generals Problem, specifically as it pertains to distributed payment systems, many suffer from high latency induced by the requirement that all nodes within the network communicate synchronously.*\n\n*In this work, we present a novel consensus algorithm that circumvents this requirement by utilizing collectively-trusted subnetworks within the larger network. We show that the \u201ctrust\u201d required of these subnetworks is in fact minimal and can be further reduced with principled choice of the member nodes.*\n\n*In addition, we show that minimal connectivity is required to maintain agreement throughout the whole network. The result is a low-latency consensus algorithm which still maintains robustness in the face of Byzantine failures. We present this algorithm in its embodiment in the Ripple Protocol.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was just curious, have you guys read the [Whitepaper](https://www.allcryptowhitepapers.com/Ripple-Whitepaper/) or did you do your research some other way?", "@ALFISYA25816918 ALFISYA25816918, kalo di GIC rumornya bisa free swap &amp; low spread ya?

My primary reason for choosing it is that I don't believe you can separate the *Store of Value* and *Means of Exchange* qualities of Bitcoin. Bitcoin gained value because it was useful for transferring value (SilkRoad), it's an error to think that it will continue to be valuable without being useful for transferring value.

But the internet infrastructure would have to change that can enable much more protection of identity as well as throughput; and blockchain security has to have lower barriers of entry and strong incentives. Enabling more factions to exist means greater distribution of power existing under more balance systems; collusion or coercion attempts and maintaining power have greater costs with flawed decisions posing greater risks of existing powers being overthrown.\n\nThere would also have to be base rootchain laws that everyone would uphold.

Its 24 hour trading volume is 9.36 billion. Our $BTC analysis is unchanged since Tuesday's update. Volume and price action both indicate strength from the bulls, and we expect a retest of the low 4k resistance in the coming days \ud83d\udcc8.\n\nBinance coin has been commanding the attention of the crypto world since the beginning of February. In about one month, its price has appreciated by more than 150% against the dollar. Volume has continued to flow into BNB since the beginning of 2019. The euphoria phase seems to have set in for $BNB \u263a\ufe0f.\n\nWith nearly every major influencer, including CZ (CEO of Binance), discussing the exchange's native token, we wanted to shed some light, once again, on the project and what has influenced it of late.\n\nTo begin, Binance is one of the most widely used, if not the most widely used, crypto exchange in the space \ud83c\udf0f. This drives notoriety to the token and its use in trading, as it is an active trading pair to 50+ cryptocurrencies on Binance. \n\nIt is also common to view the ownership of $BNB as an opportunity to participate in the success of Binance. Casual crypto investors are not the only ones to view Binance as a strong product or savvy market operator/investor. \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf7Word from the Argentine government has come forth regarding their approach to funding national blockchain projects that Binance also invests in. \n\nThe country\u2019s Ministry of Production and Labour announced Wednesday that it will match investments of up to $50,000 into every Argentine blockchain project that receives funding from Binance Labs via the second season of its incubator program and LatamEX Founders Lab. This ultimately shows the level of respect that major governments have for Binance\u2019s decision making in the blockchain space.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, we think $BNB may have to take a breather before its next leg up. We expect the $16-17 range to provide heavy resistance to $BNB. It is hard to ignore the amount of volume surging in, or the golden cross that occurred on the daily for $BNB on February 27th (see chart below\ud83d\udc47). We expect a short-term retrace to the $11-12 range that will act as support.\n\nWe have mentioned before that, as a strategy, our team members set aside percentages of their monthly earnings to invest solely into $BNB as a long-term play. \n\nStay tuned for updates as price action continues!", "You see, for 300 Euros you have got a very very important life lesson: If you are going to do something, especially crazy stuff, think *before* what could go wrong, not afterwards.\n\nYou both might well have broken some law about money laundering, and your friend was knowingly and intentionally giving his identity for financial transactions of someone else who would obviously not be entitled to those, oh..

The total market cap of crypto has shed nearly 90 billion USD in roughly 12 days, resulting in a 43% loss to the total market.\ud83d\udcc9\n\nAs of right now, we are still holding our low leverage shorts in order to achieve neutrality in terms of crypto exposure. This will allow us to maintain our buying power as crypto stabilizes or moves lower. \n\nOur goal now is to maintain as much of our capital as possible so that we can implement a dollar cost averaging strategy. Dollar Cost Averaging is achieved by simply formulating a plan to use predetermined percentages of one\u2019s capital to buy at select prices. \n\nOur team will be utilizing this strategy because it is a more risk averse system for \u2018catching the bottom\u2019. We will release a more detailed DCA strategy this week.\n\nOn lower time frames, we see an opportunity for $BTC to experience a mini rally from here to the $4300-4500 levels, but will wait for more consolidation before reducing our short exposure. (See Chart Below)\n\nAt this point in time, it is clear that panic is gripping cryptocurrency investors and participants everywhere. Besides the extreme sell-off, there are reports of miners selling their rigs in mass quantities at a per/pound price. Every news outlet is seemingly covering the demise of crypto as prices continue to plunge.\n\nDoes this mean crypto is truly dying? \n\nNo! \u274c\n\nDuring Bitcoin\u2019s ten year existence, the price of $BTC has suffered four bear markets that, in terms of percentage loss, were worse than the ongoing 2018 bear market. This is what is expected when dealing with emerging asset classes.

Or, it's not different than a Peso (PHP) connection between WU and Coins.\n\nI use Coins.ph fairly often to pay writers, but the majority of the writers I use do not use Coins or have even heard of it.  I use XRP to pay the writers because it's easy for me.  That said, if I had to buy a bunch of XRP to load in my Coins.ph account -- I am not sure I would use it.  Most Filipinos want PHP.  I send them XRP and they need to convert to PHP -- or I fund my Coins.ph account with XRP > then convert to PHP > send to the Coins account of a writer > the writer then cashes out their PHP at a local bank.  In this situation XRP is a transfer of value and none of its strengths are really in play -- it doesn't function different that using fiat.\n\nCoins.ph  works extremely well and has a very easy method to convert XRP to PHP and then cash out to local banks or pay various bills. I can send XRP to my Coins account and then easily spread it between various writers.  Or family members can do that with their own funds - all with very low fees.  Of course, this can also be done with fiat and other currencies on Coins - not just XRP.\n\nWestern Union is wildly popular in the Philippines, but it can be a long drive for some people while a bank that participates with Coins.ph could be a 10 minutes walk.  This seems like a good match for WU and Coins.\n\nI don't see this as a business move that has anything to do with XRP other than it's one of their listed currencies. It's a smart move for WU. \n\n**NOTE**:  Using WU you can send $1000 for $10.  It will be interesting to see if non-Filipino's can use this feature.

The best money is thus the one that does this most effectively, including: (1) reducing the friction associated with finding a transacting partner (by having a large network effect, i.e., being widely held and accepted): (2) reducing the friction associated with making an individual transaction (by being fast, cheap, and reliable to transact); and (3) reducing the friction associated with holding money between transactions (by having a predictable, finite supply). BTC is still the leader with respect to the first category (which is arguably the most important, certainly that's true in the short-term), but it's absolutely shitting the bed when it comes to the second.  Indeed, BTC is in a really ugly spot where as it becomes a better money along one essential dimension (thanks to increased adoption and network effect), it simultaneously becomes a *worse* money along *another* essential dimension (as growing congestion causes transacting to be increasingly slow, expensive, and unreliable). BTC's arbitrary limit on block space is a collar around Bitcoin\u2019s neck that turns into a noose as the network attempts to grow.\n\nBCH on the other hand is doing very well in categories two and three and at least *reasonably* well with respect to category one.

Is this not true? Cause if it was, then a high price shouldn't matter. Others brought up that it is the rate by which VET generates VTHO that can be adjusted by the foundation. In which case, more VTHO would be generated per VET, which would keep the price low on the open market.

I'm going to explain how most educators scam the students out of their money without *technically* scamming them. so even if you are not looking for an educational course, I believe you should still read this post as it can give you a clear view of the education market in trading.   \n\n\n ok, lets get into it..\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI  have taken a lot of online trading courses in my time, and while I  have learned at least one valuable lesson from each of them, a simple  vetting of their teachings showed me that their methods were more often  than not very flawed.  \nThe worst ones would effectively destroy your  account over the long haul and the good ones (and I\u2019m using the term  \u201cgood\u201d loosely here) could only make your account a profitable account  if you were trading with an EA and over a period longer than 5 years!\n\n  \n**There is a significant amount of hidden truths in the world of trading education.**\n\n  \nMost educators out there aren\u2019t necessary lying when they tell you that their trading strategy *works*!\n\nbut your definition of what \u201cworks\u201d, often times significantly differs from what they mean by the word \u201cworks\u201d.\n\nto  any new-comer to trading, a trading system/strategy that \u201cWorks\u201d is a  trading system/strategy that can be used in a specific time frame, and  deliver positive gain with limited risk.\n\nso  for example, they usually expect to open any number of trading  positions in a given period, lets say a month, and at the end of the  month, close that basket of trades and overall, turn a profit.\n\nthat\u2019s what you want to be doing as a trader, isn\u2019t it? make money instead of losing it?\n\nbut  what most educators don\u2019t tell you is that when they say a strategy  works, it almost always means that it has showed a positive gain when  they have put the strategy through back-testing.\n\nnow what is backtesting? here is the definition from investopedia:\n\n>***Backtesting*** is the general method for seeing how well a strategy or model would have done ex-post  \n*Backtesting* assesses the viability of a trading strategy by discovering how it would play out using historical data. If *backtesting* works, traders and analysts may have the confidence to employ it going forward\n\nYou  get the idea.. it basically means that they use computers to see that  if someone had been trading with this strategy since years ago till  today, would that trading account be in profit today? and if the answer  is yes, then they will count that strategy as something that works.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Now this is where the waters start to get a bit murky!**\n\nBacktesting  is a process that you define the parameters of it yourself. while there  often is a consensus over what those parameters should be set to in  order to create legitimate and trustworthy results, often times,  educators deliberately back-test a strategy in a way to mask its  inefficiencies. so for example, lets say you have a strategy that  requires you to hold trading positions for a months at a time\u2026. you  back-test it properly and you will see that it wont work if used in the  market due to the swap rates or other fees that will destroy your  supposed gains from the trades themselves.. now how can you make that  useless strategy a working one? ignore those fees in your back-testing.  that doesn\u2019t quite cut it? hell with it, lets average the spread around  to make it work.\n\nnow  you might ask yourself, \u201cwhy would anyone even bother mess with their  own backtesting?\u201d and the answer is simple, because if they can get a  back-testing that is showing proper results, no matter how faulty that  backtesting process is, it still gives them legal grounds to claim they  haven\u2019t committed fraud when saying their strategy \u201cworks\u201d, it would be  just a matter of an error in calculations that could happen to anyone!\n\nAlso,  a lot of times, they don\u2019t even need to manipulate the data that much.  they can pick one of the strategies that shows positive gains when  back-testing, and market it as something that its not.\n\nSo  lets say you have back-tested a strategy over 8 years of data and you  have jumped through all the hoops and have made sure your strategy is  sound and can be still deployed going forward.\n\nnow  what most educators do is that they hide the pieces of truth that they  deem are irrelevant to the topic. because after all, they just said that  the trading strategy works, which is technically true. but what they  chose not to tell you is that the fact that a trading strategy can show  profits in backtesting, is not enough for it to be a useful method for  retail traders.\n\nwhy?  because for that strategy to show a positive gain, it had to be used on  every trading opportunity on the chart (based on the strategy\u2019s rules)  so at the end of the test, the combined result of all those trading  positions can generate a profit.\n\nthat  means, that if you take that strategy and use it in a shorter  time-period, and miss a couple of trading opportunities here and there,  you are no longer on the same path as that back-testing, you are in a  whole new territory and chances are you won\u2019t be able to generate  profits or the profits generated could be significantly less than what  you had imagined.\n\n**This  is what most educators hide from you, because their livelihood depends  on you not knowing how they are manipulating the truth.**\n\nThey are not all fraudsters, but almost all of them are half-truthers!\n\nAnd  the saddest part of all this is that they often manage to charge people  significant amounts of money in order to teach them something that  won\u2019t help them in their trading. so they take a strategy and package it  in some nice flare and market it as a \u201cquick-fix\u201d for anyone desperate  enough to pay for it, and they pocket the money while you end up losing  yours to the market.\n\noften  times, they encourage students to stay the hell away from lower time  frames charts and stick to trading 8 hour or daily charts. the reason  for that is that using higher time frame charts, makes the \u201crealization  process\u201d a lot longer.   \nso it will actually take the students months  or often years before they figure out that the method they have paid a  lot of money for, doesn\u2019t work.\n\nAnd  the even sadder part is that by this time, the educator often chalks up  the whole thing to the market \u201cevolving\u201d which has rendered the  strategy useless now.\n\nSo  you end up back on the first square, scammed out of your hard earned  money while achieving nothing in the process and god forbid, incurring  more losses in the process.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[I\u2019m a highly successful day trader](https://www.quora.com/profile/Bahman-RasoulPour-Linorth). \n\n  \nLast  year, I broke the record of Michael Burry (the guy shoring the US  housing market in 2008) by achieving 783% of profit in 11 days of  trading, with a drawdown of only 11.51% [\\[\\*\\]](https://linorth.com/)   \nI  did that live, in front of my followers in my telegram channel.  manually entering and exiting 806 trading positions during that 11 day  period. managing to turn $2500 into $17000.  \nAnd if you want to see my  performance during the last 3 years of running my telegram channel, you  can visit it and check it out by scrolling to the old posts. (link is  in my website)  \nif I  wanted to scam people out of their money, I could have easily create a course and attach that trade explorer to it and make a boatload of money  off of it. but I didn\u2019t.   \nyou know why? because I knew there is not a  quick-fix strategy for achieving that level of success in trading. \n\n  \nI was one of the few traders insisting on shorting Bitcoins on 20 Feb 2018, here is the analysis I had on it when the market was still showing an strong upward move!\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/wlBJSNaQ-BTCUSD-Daily/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/wlBJSNaQ-BTCUSD-Daily/)\n\n  \nand here is my signal for going long again 3 months ago at 3500 price level!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/HGmZqbFO-Time-to-go-bullish-again-on-BTC/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/HGmZqbFO-Time-to-go-bullish-again-on-BTC/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm really good at my job and I have the evidence to back that claim up.   \nin  order to become a profitable trader (and by profitable I mean a trader that wins more trades than he loses in any given time-period  -wins>losses-) you need to first understand the market itself, and  learn how it functions and then learn how to distinguish between a  high-probability trading opportunity and a low probability one, so you  can effectively become profitable in your trading, and from there, its  only a matter of calibrating your entries better to increase your  profitability beyond what those so-called educators tell you is  impossible.\n\n  \nAfter about 2 years of people sending me messages asking me to teach  them how to trade, I\u2019ve very recently decided to run my own [Mentorship Program](https://linorth.com/mentorship-program/).\n\nI  believe its the best course out there, Because unlike all the other trading educators out there, I don\u2019t like doing my education on old  charts that have already played out and everyone can see where the price  has moved to. \n\nMost educators offer a course that explains everything on an old chart and when it comes to live trading in real  time, all they do is basically giving two sided advice and no real  direction or a tangible process of assessing the market conditions in  real time for making trading decisions.   \nbut I like to do most of my  teaching live in real time in a more hands on approach so my students  can watch their mentor implement the method live in real time and learn  to do it themselves on their own.\n\nThe  registration is limited to 100 students because the mentorship program includes a private 1-1 session with each and every student so I can  personally guide them in their education process and help them in  absorbing the information of the course as well as its implementation  live in real time in the market.\n\nI  don\u2019t offer a quick-fix strategy to fix all your trading problems, what  I do offer is a chance to have a professional trader guide you on your  trading journey and help you get to a place where you can assess the market conditions and make trading decisions all on your own based on sound logic and nothing else.   \n\n\nThe program is 3 months long and costs only $499.\n\n  \nDuring  the 3 months of the program you will also get 3 months of free access  to my trading floor which normally costs $99 per month on top of the  course.   \nThat makes the price of the program itself about $200!   \n\n\nThe course is honestly very heavily undervalued.\n\nI  personally spent about $2K on my education in the first year for a  mentorship program that lasted only 2 months and was overall 8 classes  lasting 3 hours each and it only covered basics plus some pattern  trading!  \nand over the years I have spent over $10K on various trading  books and courses online and have absorbed all that information and  have put the best parts of each of those courses together to create my  own method and now I\u2019m giving all of the best parts bundled up together  for an affordable fee!  \nMost traders lose a lot of money with trial  and error of methods that doesn\u2019t work, so if you are one of them or  don\u2019t want to become one, now is your chance to have someone who is  already making money from the market teach you how its done.\n\nI  personally have spent way more money on courses that I only hoped might  add 2% to my ROI, because even if it thought me something that could  add even a small percentage to my ROI, over the long haul it would pay  for itself.  \nso think of the mentorship as an investment in your own future as a trader.\n\n&#x200B;", "RT @krisajenkins: Given that git is a blockchain hes aiming too low. https://t.co/cipdm8sbzC", "Bitcoins Misery Index Indicates Euphoria in the Cryptocurrency Markets: Fundstrats TomLee https://t.co/VbffEJV4iI https://t.co/N4sQiNNKzx", "#LITECOIN \n\nThe truth is, that my latest bullish view (target 185 USD) is wrong. \n\nUptrendchannel is broken.

The project is broken into two phases. Phase 1 introduces various security and performance improvements, while phase 2 implements failure recovery and mempool synchronization. \n\nAs of last week, phase 1 is complete except for two documentation tasks, and will be rolled out with BU release 1.6.0. Accordingly, I thought that now would be a good time to summarize and quantify the impact of the work that will be included in the release. To that end, I've written an [interim report](https://github.com/bissias/graphene-experiments/blob/master/jupyter/graphene_v2_interim_report.ipynb) (if this link fails to render, then please try [this one](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bissias/graphene-experiments/blob/master/jupyter/graphene_v2_interim_report.ipynb) instead). Here are some of the highlights from that report.\n\n* Like Compact blocks, Graphene now encodes transaction IDs using SipHash with a unique key shared between sender and receiver, which greatly minimizes the risk of a transaction collision attack.\n* Graphene block failure rates have been dramatically lowered; on average, fewer than 1 block per day fails to decode.\n* Various compute optimizations have lowered the time to encode and decode a Graphene block by at least 30%.\n* By leveraging CTOR, we have removed transaction ordering information to further improve Graphene compression rates.\n\nThe report includes a test that we ran on over 500 sequential blocks from mainnet. During that test, we experienced 2 decode failures and were forced to request missing transactions 4 times. The overall mean compression rate was 0.995. For blocks with more than 1000 transactions, the mean compression rate was 0.998. The largest block, containing 2545 transactions, had a compression rate of 0.999.", "hahaha im buying but low", "Fundstrats Tom Lee: Current #Bitcoin Misery Index Never Been Reported in Bear Market https://t.co/tP9bX58VL3 via https://t.co/SbacW7WcyB", "@ParrillaDiego With bitcoin transactions are fast, so the FX risk is quite low, unlike with fiat money.", "Tom Lees Bitcoin Misery Index Hits Highest Value Since 2016 in Possible Bull Signal https://t.co/OJWesWDZm3 https://t.co/idpXEbhk1N", "#BTC #ETH #BCH #LTC #XRP The cryptocurrency market is trading with marginal and low volatility.

But we can do something about the demand side through adoption, adoption, adoption. In fact, I value Bitcoin Cash more than I value fiat, which is why I sold my fiat for Bitcoin Cash.

SOOOO if you take the rest of the equation...\n\n\n1) Plug in current price of VTHO (.0008) -->  you get that VET price should be $0.80... WAY higher than where we are today.\n\n\n2) Plug in current price of VET (.007) --> you get that VTHO price should be $0.00007...WAY lower than where we are today.

YES, the foundation can change levers to decrease VTHO/transaction, BUT I don't anticipate they want to have to do that frequently... the problem is that people are HOLDING vtho expecting a significant increase in value.  \n\n\nThis is stupid.  Sell your VTHO and maintain enough liquidity on OCE that price goes where it needs to.  Our wealth based on what they've shown us for months in the whitepaper is PURELY based on that last term, i.e. mass adoption.  It's ALWAYS been that way. \n\n\nAnd lastly, for the people that say the foundation doesn't care if VET price goes up because they make their money selling services.... do you REALLY think the 100 people took a job at a high risk venture purely for the smaller reward of building a services company??

If the transaction is mined, the money will be in the merchant's hand. The only way to get it back is that the merchant makes a transaction to you. It's something you have to communicate with the merchant.\n\nIf you decide to cancel a purchase before the transaction is mined, you can broadcast a new transaction spending the same BTC to an address you control, with a higher fee. Some miners may drop the old transaction and mine and new one because it's more profitable. Such scenario is called race attack and normally considered bad. However, there is the need to accelerate stuck transactions with low fees. The need is similar to yours. Some technologies are developed to solve the problem: Replace By Fee (RBF) and Child Pays For Parent (CPFP).\n\nWith RBF, the transaction has a flag indicating whether it's final, or in other words, whether a replaced fee in a replacement transaction in the future is possible. New transactions spending the same BTC can be created and accepted if the old one is not final and the fee of the new one is higher, until the final flag is set, in which case no new replacement transaction will be accepted. It's said some miners give non-final RBF transactions low priorities, though.\n\nWith CPFP, a new transaction (child) is created that spends the receiving address of the previous transaction (parent), which has not been mined. The new transaction has a high combined fee. Both transactions are included in the same block to be mined. When mined, only the address in the child transaction has BTC.\n\nBoth RBF and CPFP can be used to stop the BTC to be sent to the merchant, although RBF is probably more economic. Note that none of the three solutions (race attack, RBF and CPFP) guarantees the outcome. It depends on whether the original transactions is mined and if the miner will include the new transaction.", "Sad reality", "Adam Schiff: just as much of a slimy, low IQ authoritarian-loving bootlicker today as he was back in December 2016. https://t.co/5V8YuKakkH", "[#Bitcoin] We are running low in cash reserves, please help! https://t.co/Yr8Jvc8fB4 https://t.co/L0DtHzyTst", "... be bought &amp; sold.

As follows are my personal opinions on why I feel Bitcoin Cash is the future of digital cash over the legacy Bitcoin.\n\nBetter Security \u2013 Bitcoin has a vulnerability called RBF which increases the risk of double spending. Bitcoin Cash developers aim to make 0-confirmation transactions safe again so that anyone accepting Bitcoin Cash is much safer accepting payments without having to wait for multiple confirmations.\n\nImproved Scalability \u2013 Bitcoin is limited to 1MB block size and even with Segwit activated, the capacity increase is only around 1.7x whereas the upgraded Bitcoin Cash blocks capacity is currently at 8x with no limitations. This means Bitcoin Cash can handle Visa/Mastercard transactions volume in the future with another upgrade.\n\nSupply Scarcity \u2013 During the fork from Bitcoin, some Bitcoin Cash supply were removed from active circulation due to users unable to claim their Bitcoin Cash from unsupported exchanges and wallets among other reasons. This means each Bitcoin Cash is actually more scarce than the legacy Bitcoin.\n\nImproved Confirmation Times \u2013 Due to the limited block size of Bitcoin, some users were made to wait days for their transactions to be confirmed. Contrast this to Bitcoin Cash where transactions may be accepted immediately with less risk and you can see why it makes sense to use Bitcoin Cash. In other words, if you are a shop owner and you just sold a cup of coffee and some sandwiches, and you accept the old legacy Bitcoin, you may have to wait hours for the transaction to be confirmed because the customer may use RBF to void the original payment. With Bitcoin Cash, your risk is minimized.\n\nLow Fees \u2013 One of the advantages of using cryptocurrencies over traditional payment methods is the low fees. Due to the limited block size of Bitcoin, fees have reached as much as $70/transaction during peak period. On the other hand, I have never paid more than 1 penny/transaction during my entire time in using Bitcoin Cash. This makes using Bitcoin Cash ideal for merchants, businesses, companies and everyday usage. The industries that may be disrupted such as Remittances, Payment Gateways, etc are worth trillions of dollars and Bitcoin Cash is well positioned for use cases in these industries.\n\nPrivacy - Yep, Bitcoin Cash has privacy now.\n\nTokens - Yep, lots of business building on top of Bitcoin Cash because it is easy to create tokens on BCH.\n\nThere are so much more and I don't even know where to start... such as Cash Accounts etc.\n\nAt the moment, the old legacy Bitcoin has network effects advantages just like how Friendster used to dominate the social networking space. Since Bitcoin Cash was only out for 2 months, it would remain to be seen how much time would be needed to play catch up. It took Facebook years to catch up to Friendster\u2019s dominance back then and it may take Bitcoin Cash just as long to achieve the same.", "The problem you run into with spamming is that miners still (generally) have a floor of 1 sat/byte.\n\nbecause you pay per byte, it means that it's twice as expensive to spam and fill a 2MB block than it is a 1MB block... and twice over again for a 4MB block.\n\nTrue spam would be data that is of no value to anyone. In order to spam blocks today at the lowest 1sat/byte level, it would cost $25 to fill an 8MB block. This would also cause no major disruption because anyone trying to make a transaction could pay 2 sat / byte instead of 1 so the only inconvenience is they paid around 0.02\u00a2  instead of 0.01\u00a2 for their transaction. (and yes, that's two 100ths of a penny... not two pennies.)\n\nTo force fees into more uncomfortable territory of 10\u00a2 or more where we start to lose some advantages over existing payment mechanisms, the malicious person would need to pay around 100 sat/byte and each 8MB block would now cost them $2500 to spam.\n\nThat only brings the network to a \"meh\" usable instead of \"this is amazing\" usable position and by no means does the network grind to a halt.\n\nUp the block size to 32MB and it suddenly costs $10k every 10 minutes to spam a block. A week's worth of spam at this level would cost the company $10M\n\nThere's also the possibility that people store data instead of transactions...\n\nIf someone decides to put information of some worth on the chain, it will cost around $12 just to persist a mid-quality JPEG or $50k to persist a compressed movie at the lowest fee level. There is also no opportunity to edit after it's on the blockchain,\n\nIt still wouldn't cause any disruption to transactions as even the process of uploading an entire compressed movie to a 32MB chain would span around 48 blocks and only effect 1sat/byte transactions.\n\nI also don't know that I'd call this spam as someone is paying to use the chain for a different, but intentional purpose.\n\nKeeping the blocksize low actually makes it easier and cheaper to spam the chain.", "This is an ultra-complex discussion.\n\nIf it appears simple, it\u2019s because you don\u2019t know enough.\n\nNobody \u201csupports\u201d fees, but they are absolutely critical to the long term health of the network.\n\nDo you run a full node? If so, you\u2019d understand that the larger the blockchain, the longer it takes to sync initially, which limits the number of people willing to run a full node. Fewer nodes run by fewer individuals means higher centralization, which could easily lead to censorship, etc.\n\nMiners will require fees to continue to increase and maintain the hash rate. The block subsidy is designed to reduce every four years (halving) which means that miners\u2019 current revenue stream is dwindling away. That MUST be replaced by fees to maintain the network.\n\nThere are other subtleties involved, but this issue is constrained by security requirements, not consumer satisfaction with fees.\n\nWhich is to say that on-chain Bitcoin transactions ARE gold, and were designed to be gold.\n\nFortunately the solution is at hand.\n\nThe Lightning Network (\u26a1\ufe0f) provides for nearly instantaneous, ultra-low-fee transactions.\n\nIndependent of fees, on chain transactions are, always have been, and always will be \u2014 unless someone figures out something one hell of a lot more clever than increasing the block size \u2014 entirely unacceptable for wide-spread retail use.\n\n\u26a1\ufe0f fixes that completely AND provides for improved privacy as well.", "@GlobalProTrader @TFMetals @Alex62539641 I've been loading up on low-interest money-from-thin-air fiat fraudulent l https://t.co/lI2JZFnt6d", "#Korruption and #cryptocurrency is trending....that's what the #corrupt are known for...#sad part are the #govt pro https://t.co/pF8ucJUJqy", "Cho Cho Cho, wee you keep quiet!?

Both systems had been built following the guide [Raspibolt](https://github.com/Stadicus/guides/tree/master/raspibolt) and some parts of [Thundroid](https://github.com/Stadicus/guides/tree/master/thundroid)  although I found that the last one was a little bit outdated. These  guides are incredibly helpful for maintaning your node in these low-end  machines. Thanks to Stadicus and the rest of contributors.\n\nI  don't have much money on the node and closing all channels and  reopening would had lead to lose perhaps 20-30% of all my Bitcoin in  onchain fees. So I though of migrating from the Raspberry to the HC1 and  see what happenned, as I have seen some vague descriptions on how to do  it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8da6tn/transferring_lightning_node_to_different_computer/) and [here](https://gist.github.com/bretton/22f628caffde79390a796e75ea528053).   As the two systems, file paths, user names, OS, LND versions, etc are  very similar if not identical, I decided to try it. I think it is  critical to have the same LND version to migrate smoothly.\n\nSteps I followed:\n\n\\- I stopped lnd and Bitcoind in both systems : 'sudo systemctl stop lnd' and 'sudo systemctl stop bitcoind'\n\n\\-  Ensured that they were successfully closed 'sudo systemctl status  lnd/bitcoind'. I suppose that if there was some error during stop, it is  good to start over the node and try to stop it again.\n\n\\-  Used WinCSP to transfer the whole lnd folder from the RPi (in my case  it was in /mnt/hdd/ and used the same tool to insert the folder on the  HC1 in same location). In my case, I had already started on the HC1 an  LND node without any channel, so I renamed the LND folder on the HC1 to  be able to copy the new one.\n\n\\- Changed  the ports 8333 and 9735 on the router to point on the HC1 instead of the  RPi, although I think I could have simply assign the RPi IP address to  the HC1.\n\n\\- Copied the tls certificate and macaron files as shown several times on the Stadicus guide, as\n\n    $ sudo cp /home/bitcoin/.lnd/tls.cert /home/admin/.lnd   $ cd /home/bitcoin/   $ sudo cp --parents .lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/admin.macaroon /home/admin/ \n\n\\- I started Bitcoind. 'sudo systemctl start bitcoind' and waited to sync the chain 'bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo'\n\n\\-I started the LND node 'sudo systemctl start lnd'. The 'sudo journalctl -f -u lnd' showed that LND was waiting to be unlocked.\n\n\\-  I used 'lncli unlock' (I read some people that it was better to use  'lncli create' and use the seed from the old node, but I think this  doesn't work, or at least the channels will need to be closed anyway)   Using 'lncli unlock', I typed the password used on the RPi and voil\u00e0!  LND successfully unlocked and everything works correctly.\n\n\\-  I assume it is important to ensure that the old RPi node never tries to  start LND.

After a strong move in December, price trended lower and retraced to the .79 OTE level (optimal trade entry).\n\nPrice began to consolidate above high demand zones (places where buyers stepped in). A weekly trading range was created and IOTA has continued to trade within this range for several weeks. Price swept both the high and low of the aforementioned range. \n\nWe believe these are the early indicators of strength for a market structure reversal in IOTA\ud83d\udcc8 \n\nWe will be monitoring IOTA closely as it interacts with the middle of the range, EQ (equillibrium) to see if it is able to maintain that crucial level. \n\nThis would be another indicator of strength for IOTA's short-mid term price action.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nWe have not been compensated to share this information.

This is a very bullish price structure, but like we said, this is most likely only a short-term bottom. \n\nOur break-out target on $BTC is $4340. If that price can be closed above on any significant time frame (4hr, 12hr, D), then our target will assume a price around $5200.\n\nWe are beginning to scale back into crypto at this time to play an estimated short term (48 hour-14 day) swing. This swing play will be invalidated if $BTC closes below $3600 on a significant time frame.\n\nTo accompany the positive price action, ErisX exchange has announced they raised 27.5 million USD in their most recent fundraising round. \n\nInvestors in this round include Fidelity and Nasdaq, two companies we have spoken about recently that are also executing their own endeavors in the space. \n\nErisX is hoping to launch next year, pending regulatory approval. They will offer the trading of both spot and futures markets for Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash. \n\nThis fits the narrative of late that ample money is still flowing into crypto, just not directly into the crypto assets themselves at this time. \n\nUnderstanding the long game of emerging markets is very important to remaining profitable. \n\nWe do believe, long-term, the investor interest from financial juggernauts such as the ones mentioned above will aid in the evolution of the crypto space into a multi-trillion dollar asset class. \n\nThat being said, crypto still has many months before these products are implemented.

I decided to delete it as I could see that the discussion was becoming overheated and was counterproductive to achieving a good outcome for the community\n- I have decided to clarify this point publicly as I can see where the current hype about censorship on the Cardano Reddit forum is going (juicy articles on CCN and the likes regarding how toxic the Cardano community is becoming, etc...). This would be the worst possible outcome for the community\n- the purpose of my post was not to vilify IOHK in any way as I have too much respect for the organisation and for Charles but to actually create a healthy debate which could kickstart a learning curve on how things can be done better\n- I now realise that my choice of words was not optimal as the use of the words deceptive or misleading can be found to indicate that there was a purposeful intent to deceive. I do not believe that this is the case as I hold IOHK\u2019s professionalism and integrity in high regard. I do apologise for this mishap\n- I am a real early investor and long term investor who is sophisticated enough to have done the required due diligence and has stuck by the project since the 2017 lows to $1.38 and back down to 2.8 cents all the way to today\u2019s current price levels and has never wavered in its unending support for the project. To be called by some on this forum a FUDster, a troll, scum of the earth and other names is a sad reflection of the fact that we do have a long way to go with regards to self governance and liquid democracy as people tend to be feral with one another especially on social media. Let us have a good hard look at ourselves before judging one another the next time around\n- to come back to my original comment and why I have started this discussion, it has now become apparent that there is a disconnect between what Charles believes has been communicated to the community and what some segments of the community perceive has been communicated. This is not the first time it has happened and will not be the last time unless only updates on what has been accomplished to date and what remains to be accomplished are provided with no indications of timeframes. I would be fine with this approach provided that the information is dumbed down as much as possible in order to ensure that the information is communicated to all the segments of the community\n\nIn summary, I think it would be good for everyone to take a deep breath and realise that we are heading in the right direction and that things could be done slightly differently for the benefit of the community. I certainly did not expect my post to be so controversial. The silver lining is that we can all learn from the experience.

Actually doing transactions with it isn't the main concern.\n\nBCH: Mostly concerned with being able to use BCH as a currency, so prioritizing fast transactions speeds and low fees.\n\nIn my limited experience it indeed seems like BCH moves around quicker and has lower fees, so it seems like it's accomplishing this goal. On the flipside, BTC people seem to be more concerned with just holding an asset that can appreciate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLooking around on both Reddit and Youtube, you hear all kinds of conflicting info. Some conflicting claims I've seen recently:\n\n**1)** \"*Lightning Network is a bandaid tacked on to solve a problem but can't actually solve it because it's a layer on top of the network, so it sucks.*\" vs \"*Lightning network has revolutionized and renewed everything! BTC forever!*\"\n\n**2)** \"*BCH volume and acceptance is way down, and it's on it's way out*.\" (Despite CoinMarketCap and monthly/yearly charts showing the opposite.) Saw some posts on Reddit yesterday saying \"*Someone who uses BCH in 2019? LOL NOOB*\". BCH is still ranked #4 on CoinMC above many other growing coins, so it doesn't seem like it's exactly on it's \"way out\"...\n\n**3)** \"*BCH is just a splinter of the real thing, so it's stupid*\" seems to be a pretty strong sentiment among BTC-purists. Though it is a splinter, it does seem to actually be more useful as a currency than BTC...\n\n**4)** Seems recently that the further split of BCHABC and the other one has made BCH lose even more credibility among broad-market observers, while those in the trenches seem to say \"*Each splinter is another step in the evolution of making the perfect crypto!*\"\n\nAll in all it's surprising how this whole debate and constant back-and-forth almost puts democrat-vs-republic loyalist fighting to shame. It borders on mind-controlled cult zealot levels, making it hard to push through all the opinions and facts. Another difficulty is that almost every time someone is saying something about a specific crypto, it's biased because they're invested in that one.\n\nSo I guess my questions are (and I realized which subreddit I'm asking this in, so I expect some bias, but would love to hear your thoughts...):\n\n**A)** Rather than BCH vs BTC, is it possible/reasonable to visualize a future where they both play big roles? Or does one eventually have to \"win out\" putting the other one out of business?\n\n**B)** Do you hold both for different reasons? Or have you gone all-in on one?\n\n**C)** If you're all-in on BCH, is your primary reason for choosing it the fact that it's useful as a currency? Or are you also aiming to have it appreciate drastically to boost your portfolio so you can switch to cash at some point?\n\nSuper long and winding post, but any feedback would be helpful for me to move forward!\n\nThanks in advance!", "RT @Rhythmtrader: More financial surveillance\nMore quantitative easing\nMore elimination of cash\nMore low interest rates\nMore deficit spendi", "@Bitcoin @ErikVoorhees @aantonop @PeterMcCormack @lopp @barrysilbert @VinnyLingham @novogratz No!

(Though I imagine the latter drawback would be negated by the ability to exchange on demand from a stable coin to an exchange currency like xlm to a local fiat currency at the pos..) \n\nBit of a rant, my apologies, if there's any solutions already out there I'd love to hear from you! Alternatively, what barriers is the crypto industry working to overcome right now that will result in an eventual flood of adoption/application? \n\n\n\n", "7Do not despair if you have not, the Lord does not ask us for much other than faith in the #blockchain and support https://t.co/J0LZGrqAr4", "\"What is something you regret buying?

Now lets get to the topic of this thread.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me start with my own story. I was aware of the Bitcoin Cash hard fork coming in 2017 and I had my Bitcoin ready for the fork. After the fork for about a week of patiently waiting and researching how to safely transfer my Bitcoin before claiming my Bitcoin Cash, I did so. Not too long after that, I was amazed at how or even why I instantly had additional value in my crypto portfolio because of this Bitcoin Cash. But I thought to myself. \"I'm not gonna use this thing, I'm still using and saving my Bitcoin. F\\_ck it, I'm going to sell it for more Bitcoin\".  And I did just that. I got X% more Bitcoin and I was like \"thanks for that\". Then about December of 2017 when the bull rally was peaking, I can honestly say that I did have a little regret or remorse for selling my Bitcoin Cash. I thought \"Aww man. If I had kept my 1:1 BTC+BCH then my portfolio would be even bigger right now\". But I didn't let it bother me I accepted my decision at the time and I moved on with my life. Fast forward to the past few weeks up to today of me writing this thread, I take back that regret and I am 100% accepting of my decision to sell my Bitcoin Cash and I am actually very happy that I did. Honestly I am 100% happy with my selling of BCH after the hard fork and getting more BTC. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet explain why. Most of the reason why comes down to data and a few fundamentals. On 1 August 2017 at Block number 478,558 Bitcoin had its first ever hard fork and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) started its own blockchain with its own rules and a code similar to Bitcoin, but still different and non-compatible. At that block, Bitcoin's supply was approximately 16,484,738 and all of a sudden Bitcoin Cash had a supply of 16,484,738 also. All BCH did was basically \"copy + paste\" the blockchain prior to the hard fork block. Its a copy, a phony, a fake, a rip off, a knock off. There was no actual work or especially any Proof Of Work (POW) for BCH's coin supply of 1 up to 16,484,738. Think about it for a minute. There is NO REAL genesis block for BCH! No, STOP reading for a moment and think about what I just said. The supply of BCH from 1 to 16,484,738 has a true and honest value of Sh\\_t. Really it does. Where is the worth for that coin supply range? Where is the VALUE? There is none! Now in all fairness with BCH, the only actual value that I can honestly see is from the coin supply of 16,484,738 to today of approximately 17,717,100 (time of my writing, plus or minus a few blocks) which is only a coin supply of approximately 1,232,362. That is the only real value that I see with BCH and its blockchain and there miners doing work. I think its funny that Traders today think that BCH should be trading at about $300 or 0.0585xxxx BTC? Really? Wow! Given the stats I just gave you then the fair market cap of Bitcoin Cash that has any actual value should only really be worth about $369,708,600. That puts BCH back to about # 26 on coinmarketcap. And My same logic and theory goes for BTG, BSV, LCC and any of these hard forked coins. Just copy + pasted blockchains. OK, so why didn't some of the value of BTC get subtracted to fulfill the value gap between BTC and BCH? Sit on that thought for a moment too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow you might be thinking or saying \"3Lb4ZRGPAq6Xfo doesn't know what he is talking and he doesn't understand the technology and blockchains and he doesn't understand what Satoshi really wanted for Bitcoin. And he doesn't understand that BCH blocks handle more and there's practically no fees for sending BCH. And, and, and BCH is the 'real bitcoin', not BTC\". Yea, yea, yea, bla bla bla. STFU. Listen... No one needs to be a Techie to understand everything I mentioned above. Satoshi wrote the code for Bitcoin and he/she/they executed it at block 1, a REAL Genesis Block! So you're trying to me... that back in the day when I could mine BTC on my home PC computer that I was also mining BCH at the same time also? And I didn't even know it?! Neither did Satoshi? WOW! AMAZING!!! (as I roll my eyes and shake my head). You can't fool me. I'm not stupid, I'm not an idiot and I'm not a dumb\\_ss.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRegarding Bitcoin, sure there's been updates and bugs taken care and a few second layer solutions and SegWit and Lightning and all that authentic and original and \"organically\" performed work done for Bitcoin. I applaud Satoshi and any/all developers for Bitcoin. I believe in POW. I believe in Bitcoin. I believe in Litecoin which also had its own genesis block. I believe in Zcash which again, also had its own genesis block. I also believe in Gold and Silver. I don't believe in BCH, BTG, BSV, LCC, USD, EUR, YEN, USDT or Gov Central Banks. I don't believe in anything that can not prove value like any of those things. Hence why we love \"Proof Of Work\" (POW). At this point, I can only think that BCH only has a specific use case. Which means that I need to trade some BTC or LTC for BCH and then send it. Why? because I need to send crypto super fast or because I'm a cheapskate and I can't afford a small 0.0x% fee for sending a transaction? Well I'm not a cheapskate. Lightning project is also coming along. I admit its a bit technical at the moment, but let it organically mature and grow, its going to be fine. Segwit has been working just fine for me. If I really need crypto sent and confirmed right freaking now within milliseconds, then I can use lightning, or LTC, or DASH's InstantSend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you get it now? Do you see BCH's real value? No, you still don't? OK. Give me your hand while I walk you across the street. Lets use one more example that most of us should be familiar with. Although the mechanics of this example are different to BCH vs. crypto, its value comparison is right on. Where does most of today's fiat currency come from? Lets use the US dollar for this example. In basic terms, the Government creates a bond and sells that bond to the Federal Reserve (that doesn't have anything on their balance sheet) and poof! USD currency magically springs into existence. Wow! Where is the worth for that magic poof fiat currency? Where is the value? Do you get it now? We all know there are other factors regarding debt attached to that fiat and fractional reserve banking, but that is beyond the topic of this thread and everyone should already know about that by now and if not, please educate a friend or family member.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion to this thread, I feel that Bitcoin Cash will go down in the crypto history books along with Mt.Gox and Bitconnect and QuadrigaCX. Or maybe I'm completely wrong... But I doubt it. Only you and the free market will decide in the end. I believe in and I am invested in the other above mentioned crypto and I will trade some other altcoins, but I have no desire to even trade BCH. I did not write this thread as a stunt or market mover or for donations. I just want to share it with you and with the world.

In\n2007\u20138, when the global financial system\nimploded, the cry that no one could have\nseen this coming was heard everywhere,\ndespite the existence of numerous analyses\nshowing that a crisis was unavoidable. \n\nThe critical\nissue is the artificial suppression of volatility\u2014the ups and downs of\nlife\u2014in the name of stability. It is both misguided and dangerous to push unobserved\nrisks further into the statistical tails of the\nprobability distribution of outcomes and\nallow these high-impact, low-probability\n\u201ctail risks\u201d to disappear from policymakers\u2019\nfields of observation. \n\nWhat the world is\nwitnessing is simply what happens when highly\nconstrained systems explode.\nComplex systems that have artificially\nsuppressed volatility tend to become\nextremely fragile, while at the same time\nexhibiting no visible risks. In fact, they\ntend to be too calm and exhibit minimal\nvariability as silent risks accumulate\nbeneath the surface.\n\n Although the stated\nintention of political leaders and economic\npolicymakers is to stabilize the system by\ninhibiting fluctuations, the result tends\nto be the opposite. These artificially constrained systems become prone to \u201cBlack\nSwans\u201d\u2014that is, they become extremely\nvulnerable to large-scale events that lie far\nfrom the statistical norm and were largely\nunpredictable to a given set of observers.\nSuch environments eventually experience massive blowups, catching everyone\noff-guard and undoing years of stability\nor, in some cases, ending up far worse than\nthey were in their initial volatile state.\nIndeed, the longer it takes for the blowup\nto occur, the worse the resulting harm in\nboth economic and political systems.\n\n\nSeeking to restrict variability seems to\nbe good policy (who does not prefer stability\nto chaos?), so it is with very good intentions\nthat policymakers unwittingly increase the\nrisk of major blowups. And it is the same\nmisperception of the properties of natural\nsystems that led the economic\ncrisis of 2007\u20138. \n\nThe policy implications\nare: to make systems robust, all\nrisks must be visible and out in the open\u2014\nfluctuat nec mergitur (it fluctuates but does\nnot sink) goes the Latin saying.\nJust as a robust economic system is one\nthat encourages early failures (the concepts\nof \u201cfail small\u201d and \u201cfail fast\u201d), the U.S. government should stop supporting dictatorial regimes for the sake of pseudostability\nand instead allow political noise to rise to\nthe surface. Making an economy robust\nin the face of business swings requires\nallowing risk to be visible; the same is\ntrue in politics.\n\nSEDUCED BY STABILITY\nBoth the recent financial crisis and the political crises in the Middle East\nare grounded in the rise of complexity,\ninterdependence, and unpredictability.\nPolicymakers in the UK and\nthe USA have long promoted\npolicies aimed at eliminating fluctuation\u2014\nno more booms and busts in the economy,\nno more \u201cIranian surprises\u201d in foreign\npolicy. These policies have almost always\nproduced undesirable outcomes.\n\n For\nexample, the U.S. banking system became\nvery fragile following a succession of progressively larger bailouts and government\ninterventions, particularly after the 1983\nrescue of major banks (ironically, by the\nsame Reagan administration that trumpeted free markets). \n\nIn the United States,\npromoting these bad policies has been a\nbipartisan effort throughout. Republicans\nhave been good at fragilizing large corporations through bailouts, and Democrats have\nbeen good at fragilizing the government.\n\n\nAt the same time, the financial system as a\nwhole exhibited little volatility; it kept getting weaker while providing policymakers\nwith the illusion of stability, illustrated\nmost notably when Ben Bernanke, who\nwas then a member of the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve, declared\nthe era of \u201cthe great moderation\u201d in 2004.\n\n\nPutatively independent central\nbankers fell into the same trap. During\nthe 1990s, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair\nAlan Greenspan wanted to iron out the\neconomic cycle\u2019s booms and busts, and he\nsought to control economic swings with\ninterest-rate reductions at the slightest\nsign of a downward tick in the economic\ndata. Furthermore, he adapted his economic policy to guarantee bank rescues,\nwith implicit promises of a backstop\u2014the\nnow infamous \u201cGreenspan put.\u201d \n\nThese\npolicies proved to have grave delayed side\neffects. Washington stabilized the market\nwith bailouts and by allowing certain companies to grow \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d Because\npolicymakers believed it was better to do\nsomething than to do nothing, they felt\nobligated to heal the economy rather than\nwait and see if it healed on its own.\n\n\nThe foreign policy equivalent is to\nsupport the incumbent no matter what.\nAnd just as banks took wild risks thanks to\nGreenspan\u2019s implicit insurance policy, client\ngovernments such as Hosni Mubarak\u2019s in\nEgypt for years engaged in overt plunder\nthanks to similarly reliable U.S. support.\n\n\nThose who seek to prevent volatility on\nthe grounds that any and all bumps in the\nroad must be avoided paradoxically increase\nthe probability that a tail risk will cause a\nmajor explosion.\n\n\nConsider a thought experiment, a man placed in an artificially\nsterilized environment for a decade and\nthen invited to take a ride on a crowded\nsubway; he would be expected to die\nquickly. Likewise, preventing small forest\nfires can cause larger forest fires to become\ndevastating. This property is shared by\nall complex systems.\n\n\nIn the realm of economics, price controls are designed to constrain volatility on\nthe grounds that stable prices are a good\nthing. But although these controls might\nwork in some rare situations, the long-term\neffect of any such system is an eventual\nand extremely costly blowup whose cleanup\ncosts can far exceed the benefits accrued.\n\n\nThe risks of a dictatorship, no matter how\nseemingly stable, are no different, in the\nlong run, from those of an artificially\ncontrolled price.\nSuch attempts to institutionally engineer\nthe world come in two types: those that\nconform to the world as it is and those\nthat attempt to reform the world. The\nnature of humans, quite reasonably, is to intervene in an effort to alter their world and\nthe outcomes it produces. But government\ninterventions are laden with unintended\u2014\nand unforeseen\u2014consequences, particularly\nin complex systems, so humans must work\nwith nature by tolerating systems that\nabsorb human imperfections rather than\nseek to change them.\n\n\nTake, for example, the recent celebrated\ndocumentary on the financial crisis, Inside\nJob, which blames the crisis on the malfeasance and dishonesty of bankers and the\nincompetence of regulators. Although it\nis morally satisfying, the film naively overlooks the fact that humans have always been\ndishonest and regulators have always\nbeen behind the curve. The only difference\nthis time around was the unprecedented\nmagnitude of the hidden risks and a misunderstanding of the statistical properties\nof the system.\n\n\n**What is needed is a system that can\nprevent the harm done to citizens by the\ndishonesty of business elites; the limited\ncompetence of forecasters, economists, and\nstatisticians; and the imperfections of\nregulation, not one that aims to eliminate\nthese flaws.** \n\nHumans must try to resist the\nillusion of control: just as foreign policy\nshould be intelligence-proof (it should\nminimize its reliance on the competence\nof information-gathering organizations\nand the predictions of \u201cexperts\u201d in what\nare inherently unpredictable domains),\nthe economy should be regulator-proof,\ngiven that some regulations simply make\nthe system itself more fragile. Due to the\ncomplexity of markets, intricate regulations\nsimply serve to generate fees for lawyers\nand profits for sophisticated derivatives\ntraders who can build complicated financial\nproducts that skirt those regulations. \n\nDON\u2019T BE A TURKEY\nThe life of a turkey before Thanksgiving\nis illustrative: the turkey is fed for 1,000\ndays and every day seems to confirm that\nthe farmer cares for it\u2014until the last day,\nwhen confidence is maximal. The \u201cturkey\nproblem\u201d occurs when a naive analysis of\nstability is derived from the absence of\npast variations. Likewise, confidence in\nstability was maximal at the onset of the\nfinancial crisis in 2007.\n\n\nThe turkey problem for humans is the\nresult of mistaking one environment for\nanother.\n\n Humans simultaneously inhabit\ntwo systems: the linear and the complex.\n\nThe linear domain is characterized by its\npredictability and the low degree of\ninteraction among its components, which\nallows the use of mathematical methods\nthat make forecasts reliable. \n\nIn complex\nsystems, there is an absence of visible\ncausal links between the elements, masking\na high degree of interdependence and\nextremely low predictability.\n\nNonlinear\nelements are also present, such as those\ncommonly known, and generally misunderstood, as \u201ctipping points.\u201d Imagine\nsomeone who keeps adding sand to a sand\npile without any visible consequence, until\nsuddenly the entire pile crumbles. It would\nbe foolish to blame the collapse on the last\ngrain of sand rather than the structure of the\npile, but that is what people do consistently,\nand that is the policy error.\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama may\nblame an intelligence failure for the government\u2019s not foreseeing the revolution\nin Egypt (just as former U.S. President\nJimmy Carter blamed an intelligence\nfailure for his administration\u2019s not foreseeing the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran),\nbut it is the suppressed risk in the statistical tails that matters\u2014not the failure to\nsee the last grain of sand. As a result of\ncomplicated interdependence and contagion effects, in all man-made complex\nsystems, a small number of possible events\ndominate, namely, Black Swans.\n\n\nEngineering, architecture, astronomy,\nmost of physics, and much of common\nscience are linear domains. The complex\ndomain is the realm of the social world,\nepidemics, and economics. \n\nCrucially, the\nlinear domain delivers mild variations\nwithout large shocks, whereas the complex\ndomain delivers massive jumps and gaps.\nComplex systems are misunderstood,\nmostly because humans\u2019 sophistication,\nobtained over the history of human knowledge in the linear domain, does not transfer\nproperly to the complex domain. \n\nHumans\ncan predict a solar eclipse and the trajectory\nof a space vessel, but not the stock market\nor Egyptian political events. All man-made\ncomplex systems have commonalities and\neven universalities. Sadly, deceptive calm\n(followed by Black Swan surprises) seems\nto be one of those properties.\n\n\nTHE ERROR OF PREDICTION\n\n\nAs with a crumbling sand pile, it would be\nfoolish to attribute the collapse of a fragile\nbridge to the last truck that crossed it, and\neven more foolish to try to predict in\nadvance which truck might bring it down.\n\nThe system is responsible, not the components. But after the financial crisis of\n2007\u20138, many people thought that predicting the subprime meltdown would have\nhelped. It would not have, since it was a\nsymptom of the crisis, not its underlying\ncause. Likewise, Obama\u2019s blaming \u201cbad intelligence\u201d for his administration\u2019s failure to\npredict the crisis in Egypt is symptomatic\nof both the misunderstanding of complex\nsystems and the bad policies involved.\nObama\u2019s mistake illustrates the illusion\nof local causal chains\u2014that is, confusing\ncatalysts for causes and assuming that one\ncan know which catalyst will produce which\neffect. The final episode of the upheaval in\nEgypt was unpredictable for all observers,\nespecially those involved. As such, blaming the cia is as foolish as funding it to\nforecast such events. Governments are\nwasting billions of dollars on attempting\nto predict events that are produced by\ninterdependent systems and are therefore\nnot statistically understandable at the\nindividual level.\n\n\nAs Mark Abdollahian of Sentia Group,\none of the contractors who sell predictive\nanalytics to the U.S. government, noted\nregarding Egypt, policymakers should\n\u201cthink of this like Las Vegas. In blackjack,\nif you can do four percent better than the\naverage, you\u2019re making real money.\u201d But\nthe analogy is spurious. \n\nThere is no \u201cfour\npercent better\u201d on Egypt. This is not just\nmoney wasted but the construction of a\nfalse confidence based on an erroneous\nfocus. It is telling that the intelligence\nanalysts made the same mistake as the\nrisk-management systems that failed to\npredict the economic crisis\u2014and offered\nthe exact same excuses when they failed.\nPolitical and economic \u201ctail events\u201d are\nunpredictable, and their probabilities are\nnot scientifically measurable. \n\nNo matter\nhow many dollars are spent on research,\npredicting revolutions is not the same as\ncounting cards; humans will never be able\nto turn politics into the tractable randomness of blackjack.\nMost explanations being offered for the\ncurrent turmoil in the Middle East follow\nthe \u201ccatalysts as causes\u201d confusion. The\nriots in Tunisia and Egypt were initially\nattributed to rising commodity prices, not\nto stifling and unpopular dictatorships.\nBut Bahrain and Libya are countries with\nhigh gdps that can a\u00aaord to import grain\nand other commodities. Again, the focus is\nwrong even if the logic is comforting. It is\nthe system and its fragility, not events,\nthat must be studied\u2014what physicists call\n\u201cpercolation theory,\u201d in which the properties of the terrain are studied rather than\nthose of a single element of the terrain.\nWhen dealing with a system that is\ninherently unpredictable, what should be\ndone? Differentiating between two types\nof countries is useful. In the first, changes\nin government do not lead to meaningful\ndi\u00aaerences in political outcomes (since\npolitical tensions are out in the open).\nIn the second type, changes in government lead to both drastic and deeply\nunpredictable changes.\nConsider that Italy, with its muchmaligned \u201ccabinet instability,\u201d is economically and politically stable despite having\nhad more than 60 governments since\nWorld War II (indeed, one may say Italy\u2019s\nstability is because of these switches of\ngovernment). \n\nSimilarly, in spite of consistently bad press, Lebanon is a relatively\nsafe bet in terms of how far governments\ncan jump from equilibrium; in spite of\nall the noise, shifting alliances, and street\nprotests, changes in government there\ntend to be comparatively mild. For example, a shift in the ruling coalition from\nChristian parties to Hezbollah is not such\na consequential jump in terms of the\ncountry\u2019s economic and political stability.\n\n\nSwitching equilibrium, with control of\nthe government changing from one party\nto another, in such systems acts as a shock\nabsorber. Since a single party cannot have\ntotal and more than temporary control, the\npossibility of a large jump in the regime\ntype is constrained.\n\n\nIn contrast, consider Iran and Iraq.\nMohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi and Saddam Hussein both constrained volatility\nby any means necessary. In Iran, when\nthe shah was toppled, the shift of power to\nAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was a huge,\nunforeseeable jump. After the fact, analysts\ncould construct convincing accounts about\nhow killing Iranian Communists, driving\nthe left into exile, demobilizing the democratic opposition, and driving all dissent\ninto the mosque had made Khomeini\u2019s\nrise inevitable. \n\nIn Iraq, the United States\nremoved the lid and was actually surprised\nto find that the regime did not jump from\nhyperconstraint to something like France.\nBut this was impossible to predict ahead\nof time due to the nature of the system\nitself. What can be said, however, is that\nthe more constrained the volatility, the\nbigger the regime jump is likely to be. From\nthe French Revolution to the triumph of\nthe Bolsheviks, history is replete with\nsuch examples, and yet somehow humans\nremain unable to process what they mean.\n\n\n\nHumans fear randomness\u2014a healthy\nancestral trait inherited from a different\nenvironment. Whereas in the past, which\nwas a more linear world, this trait enhanced\nfitness and increased chances of survival,\nit can have the reverse effect in today\u2019s\ncomplex world, making volatility take the\nshape of nasty Black Swans hiding behind\ndeceptive periods of \u201cgreat moderation.\u201d\n\n\nThis is not to say that any and all volatility\nshould be embraced. Insurance should\nnot be banned, for example.\n\n\nBut alongside the \u201ccatalysts as causes\u201d\nconfusion sit two mental biases: the illusion\nof control and the action bias (the illusion\nthat doing something is always better than\ndoing nothing). This leads to the desire to\nimpose man-made solutions. Greenspan\u2019s\nactions were harmful, but it would have\nbeen hard to justify inaction in a democracy\nwhere the incentive is to always promise a\nbetter outcome than the other guy, regardless of the actual, delayed cost.\n\n\nVariation is information. When there\nis no variation, there is no information.\nThis explains the cia\u2019s failure to predict\nthe Egyptian revolution and, a generation\nbefore, the Iranian Revolution\u2014in both\ncases, the revolutionaries themselves did\nnot have a clear idea of their relative\nstrength with respect to the regime they\nwere hoping to topple. \n\nSo rather than subsidize and praise as a \u201cforce for stability\u201d\nevery tin-pot potentate on the planet,\nthe U.S. government should encourage\ncountries to let information flow upward\nthrough the transparency that comes with\npolitical agitation. It should not fear fluctuations per se, since allowing them to be\nin the open, as Italy and Lebanon both\nshow in different ways, creates the stability\nof small jumps.\n\n\nAs Seneca wrote in De clementia,\n\u201cRepeated punishment, while it crushes\nthe hatred of a few, stirs the hatred of\nall . . . just as trees that have been trimmed\nthrow out again countless branches.\u201d The\nimposition of peace through repeated\npunishment lies at the heart of many\nseemingly intractable conflicts, including\nthe Israeli-Palestinian stalemate. \n\nFurthermore, dealing with seemingly reliable\nhigh-level offcials rather than the people\nthemselves prevents any peace treaty signed\nfrom being robust. The Romans were wise\nenough to know that only a free man under\nRoman law could be trusted to engage in a\ncontract; by extension, only a free people\ncan be trusted to abide by a treaty.\n\n Treaties\nthat are negotiated with the consent of a\nbroad swath of the populations on both\nsides of a conflict tend to survive. \n\nJust as no\ncentral bank is powerful enough to dictate\nstability, no superpower can be powerful\nenough to guarantee solid peace alone.\n\n\nU.S. policy toward the Middle East has\nhistorically, and especially since 9/11, been\nunduly focused on the repression of any\nand all political fluctuations in the name\nof preventing \u201cIslamic fundamentalism\u201d\u2014\na trope that Mubarak repeated until his\nlast moments in power and that Libyan\nleader Muammar al-Qaddafi continues\nto emphasize today, blaming Osama\nbin Laden for what has befallen him. This\nis wrong. The West and its autocratic Arab\nallies have strengthened Islamic fundamentalists by forcing them underground,\nand even more so by killing them.\n\n\nAs Jean-Jacques Rousseau put it, \u201cA\nlittle bit of agitation gives motivation to\nthe soul, and what really makes the species\nprosper is not peace so much as freedom.\u201d\nWith freedom comes some unpredictable\nfluctuation. This is one of life\u2019s packages:\nthere is no freedom without noise\u2014and\nno stability without volatility", "Canadian Province Offers Low-Cost Energy Incentives to Bitcoin Miners\nhttps://t.co/Bxqgq2OjCd\n#Blockchain #Crypto https://t.co/QV7l0hL6ep", "Incent Targets Broken Economy With Blockchain Rewards https://t.co/XuswjCIx37 #sponsored", "BUSD Stablecoin  Fastest, safest and low-cost solution for money transfer, cross-border remittance and global paym https://t.co/hQiuCrAKry", "Actual zuck bucks.

There are also VCs who've turned beautiful projects into hollowed shells of despair. Often this happens at the later stages of financing, to prepare for acquisition or a public sale. Then the founders leave and the world is hopefully a tad bit better. Anyways, just to say that not all VCs are evil and often early stage investment is essential. That's why they're called \"angel\" investors, because anyone else would be a fool to bet on early founders with early projects. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday though, things have changed. In the context of cryptoeconomic communities/platforms, it makes no sense to have VCs invested in a different round than \"common folk.\" Cryptoeconomic networks are all about community, and if the platform is legit there's no need special rounds for special investors. \\*Everyone\\* wants to get in on a rocket ship.

As a side effect, this document provides guidance when evaluating the addition of a new moderator or the re-evaluation of an existing moderator.\n\nThis document also covers the role of /r/ethereum as a public forum, as well as the roles, responsibilities, and expectations of /r/ethereum participants.\n\n# Perception & Expectations of Moderators\n\nRegardless of how moderators view themselves, many people who visit or contribute to /r/ethereum view being a moderator as a privilege, not a right, burden, nor chore. Many see the moderators as being in a trusted position which lends credibility to their statements and gives them influence. Thus, many expect moderators to reflect and represent this community, the larger Ethereum ecosystem, and the values of Ethereum. Furthermore, many expect the moderators to be dedicated to Ethereum, and to keep Ethereum\u2019s long-term growth and goals top-of-mind.\n\nModerators should be mindful that their public words have the ability and power to shape, control, and influence the discussions. Their statements have the potential to be extremely valuable and impactful.\n\nFor these reasons, moderators should be mindful about how their commentary *could be perceived* by the diverse set of people who make up the Ethereum community. While moderating, participating in discussions on /r/ethereum, and even while participating in external discussion (e.g. on Twitter, on other forums, at conferences, etc.), they should aim to be transparent, communicate clearly, be explicit about their intentions, provide necessary context, and act in good faith.\n\nWhile some existing moderators or potential moderators may see this as unnecessarily limiting or burdensome, they should understand that many in the community strongly desire and encourage moderators to be active in discussions, to engage with the community, to share their viewpoints, to participate in open debate, to promote and help shape the goals and culture of the subreddit, and, most of all, to lead by example. Being mindful does not mean one must censor themselves or avoid disagreements. It simply means that one should ensure the tone and content of their commentary is ultimately constructive, not destructive.\n\nIf, after reading the above, a moderator cannot agree to be responsible and mindful in both their /r/ethereum participation and external discussion, they should be willing to excuse themselves from that role.\n\n# Expectations of Participants\n\nIn turn, participants on /r/ethereum and people around the Ethereum ecosystem should be mindful that no one is perfect, not even /r/ethereum moderators \ud83d\ude09. Living up to the aforementioned expectations is no small undertaking. While moderators try to do their best to meet the defined expectations, contributors are asked to practice patience and civility if and when they feel a moderator is not upholding their duties to the best of their ability.\n\nAs a first approach, people are encouraged to assume good-faith and respectfully open a dialog with the moderator, preferably in a public reply to the post or comment that is particularly concerning. A good way to start this dialog is by asking for clarification to ensure the participant clearly understands what the moderator *meant*. This ensures both parties are on the same page and provides an opportunity for clarification.\n\nIf the dialog is not fruitful and a person still strongly believes a moderator is not upholding their duties. Please avoid personal insults, brigading, ad hominems, inciting a mob-like mentality, overly emotional commentary, or sharing private conversations or information without the other party\u2019s consent. By being objective and setting a tone that encourages open-minded discussion, the conversation can be productive rather than polarizing, and, thus, is more likely to lead to a positive result for the community as a whole. If there is clear identification of a breach of mod roles and responsibilities, we would invite a message to the mod group to evaluate the situation and moderator in question. If there is no response on the matter from the moderators within 10 days, than a post on the topic would be appropriate.\n\nThe action that is taken after this discussion, if any, is reliant on the amount and type of input from the community and fellow moderators and handled on a case-by-case basis. This ensures each case is approached in proper context and not prior to the presently-unknown future circumstances. Ideally, if there is a large calling for a moderator to be removed, the moderator in question will voluntarily step down. Doing so should not be interpreted as the moderator agreeing with or admitting fault to the claims presented, but simply that the moderator is willing to sacrifice their position in order to avoid further conflict and distraction.\n\nAdditional details can be found in the \u201cEvaluating a Moderator\u201d section below. Lastly, please limit discussions to a single thread so the commentary can be more easily followed.\n\n# Role of /r/ethereum in the ecosystem\n\nThis subreddit is a trusted source of information, news, announcements, and discussions regarding (almost) everything Ethereum. It is often the go-to place for the latest information and a place newcomers arrive at looking for information and help as they get started. Posts and discussions and answers to questions often show up at the top of search results. It is also currently the most widely-used forum dedicated to longer-form discussion regarding Ethereum, though some argue it is not necessarily \u201cthe best\u201d forum.\n\nSome people who were previously active participants on /r/ethereum that are no longer active participants have cited lower quality content, lower quality discussions, unproductive arguments, trollish behavior, or personal attacks as the reason for becoming inactive. Regardless of the truthfulness of those reasons, they are the feelings and perceptions of some of those who left and should not be invalidated.\n\nFurthermore, many people cite the inclusiveness and welcoming nature of the community as their reason for focusing their time and efforts on Ethereum. Some note how turned off by the maximalism they experienced in other online communities, and didn\u2019t dive deeply into the blockchain space until they found Ethereum.\n\nFor the above reasons it is vital that this community is preserved in order to onboard the next generation of Ethereum builders and contributors *and* keep the existing builders and contributors. This subreddit and the larger community should encourage newcomers and existing members alike to participate.\n\nThis **does not** mean that everyone should always be in agreement. Diversity of ideas is more valuable than agreement. As Ethereum grows, the attitudes, goals, and views of community members become more diverse. This is a positive, even with the accompanying growing pains. Debate, competition, and disagreements are necessary to push things forward and evolve. It is incredibly valuable, so long as the disagreements do not devolve and have a negative effect on the ecosystem.\n\n## /r/ethereum aims to be a place...\n\n* ...for the open and good-faith discussion about the Ethereum blockchain, decentralized applications, governance, and related technologies.\n* ...that is not in perfect agreement all the time.\n* ...that values transparency, respect, decentralization, inclusivity, diversity.\n* ...made up of unique people with different backgrounds and worldviews.\n* ...filled with healthy, critical thinking.\n* ...to help advance the goals of Ethereum.\n* ...that consistently practices respect and empathy.\n* ...that is inclusive and encouraging of all types of people with all types of experiences.\n* ...that is welcoming, helpful, and patient with newcomers.\n* ...that aids in increasing the adoption of Ethereum.\n* ...to engage in civil discourse, controversial debates, and open discussions about problems.\n* ...void of hate, vitriol, insults, slurs, threats of violence, witch hunts. ...that encourages healthy debate and critical discussions surrounding Ethereum.\n\nEach day, we should strive to create and grow a welcoming, collaborative, productive environment that contributes and grows Ethereum as a whole\u2014one that helps progress Ethereum as a technology, as a set of loosely-shared values, a better version of the web, and as a community.\n\n# Roles & Responsibilities of Moderators\n\nFirst and foremost, the role of the moderators is to serve the Ethereum community. They should act in good faith and with Ethereum\u2019s best interest at heart as they make decisions and participate in discussions.\n\nIdeally, a moderator\u2019s decisions should be objective: remove posts that clearly violate the subreddit\u2019s listed rules and approve posts that do not violate the subreddits listed rules. Realistically, posts and rules require some amount of subjectivity.\n\nModerators should be thoughtful regarding the subjective decisions they make and strive for fairness, honesty, and transparency with themselves, their fellow moderators, and with the entire community.\n\nWhen removing a post or comment that is not obviously spam or a scam, the moderator should leave a note citing the rule that was violated. When removing posts, especially those with discussion, moderators should additionally \u2018distinguish & sticky\u2019 their comment. In most cases, a reply of, \u201cWe have removed your post for violating rule #2: Price discussion. Please keep price discussion to subreddits such as /r/ethtrader.\u201d is sufficient. For removals that may be controversial, more insight should be provided.\n\n## On a day-to-day basis, a moderators tasks include...\n\n* Approving posts that were incorrectly removed by the automoderator.\n* Removing posts that break the subreddit\u2019s stated rules.\n* Bringing any posts that require subjective decision-making or fall into a \u201cgray area\u201d in the rules to the attention of the moderation team for discussion.\n* Participating in discussions, especially those regarding moderation (both public posts on /r/ethereum or discussions in the internal moderator chat).\n* When necessary, starting and leading discussions regarding updating or adjusting the subreddit rules.\n* When necessary, attempting to improve the efficiency and success-rate of the automoderator. The automoderator is a very fickle beast.\n\n## Moderators should...\n\n* ...ensure discussions stay on-topic, civil, and productive.\n* ...lead by example.\n* ...be an active participant in the subreddit by promoting civil discourse, asking thoughtful questions, and encouraging people and projects.\n* ...be calm and polite, even when other participants are not.\n* ...offer helpful rule explanations, tips, and links to new or confused users.\n* ...keep a unified front when addressing users officially.\n* ...be open to the viewpoints of other moderators and participants and try to reach consensus on difficult items.\n\n## Moderators should not...\n\n* ...moderate posts based on personal ideologies.\n* ...distinguish comments or submissions when not speaking officially on behalf of /r/ethereum.\n* ...act unilaterally when making major revisions to rules, sidebars, or stylesheets.\n* ...take moderation positions in communities where their profession, employment, or biases could pose a direct conflict of interest to the neutral and user driven nature of reddit.\n* ...encourage or \"feed\" trolls.\n* ...ban users when they have not broken any rules.\n\n## Moderators should never...\n\nModerators should never moderate posts in which the moderator has a clear conflict of interest. This includes, but is not limited to, posts regarding: the moderator in question, the moderator\u2019s own company/product/project, or companies/products/projects in which the moderator is heavily emotionally or financially invested in.\n\n## Moderators should take extra care when...\n\nModerators should take extra care when moderating posts in which the moderator has a potential conflict of interest, and consider bringing the post to the attention of fellow moderators rather than moderating it themselves. This includes, but is not limited to, posts regarding a potential or perceived conflict of interest, posts by a contributor the moderator has had negative interactions with in the past, posts regarding a competitor to the moderator\u2019s company/product/project.\n\n## Moderators are not expected to\u2026.\n\nWhile moderators should endeavour to comply with the above roles and responsibilities, there are some items that are not expected of moderators.\n\n* Moderators do not need to be working full-time for Ethereum or Ethereum-related projects. Moderators are encouraged to have a life outside of /r/ethereum.\n* Moderators are not expected to disclose their financial investments or general financial state with anyone. Furthermore, moderators can invest in the assets they choose and even support non-Ethereum projects, provided the moderator does not act nor moderate against Ethereum or it\u2019s long-term interests.\n* Moderators do not need to hold viewpoints that are widely accepted by the community. Moderators may themselves promote civil debate on controversial items or hold contradictory ideas, so long as those are expressed within the rules of the /r/ethereum subreddit and are not clearly against Ethereum\u2019s long-term interests.\n* Moderators are not expected to produce a certain number of posts or comments. Moderators should be performing their duties and engaging with the community with at least a weekly cadence.\n\n## Evaluating a Mod\n\nIn response to the feedback received from members of the community and the reasons outlined in the \u201cPerception & Expectations of Moderators\u201d section above, the following items attempt to provide some guidelines for evaluating a moderator or calling for the removal of a moderator.\n\nEach case will be unique and this is not a comprehensive list. For example, a moderator may provide value in other ways not included in this list and that value should not be discredited or ignored when evaluating.\n\n* Do they support the Ethereum community?\n* Do they act in good faith and with Ethereum\u2019s best interests at heart?\n* Do they aim to ensure discussions stay on-topic, civil, productive?\n* Do they lead by example? (Some examples could include: promoting civil discourse, engaging in discussion, asking thoughtful questions, encouraging people and projects.)\n* Have they ever moderated a post in which there is a potential or perceived conflict of interest without first consulting other mods?\n* Have they ever moderated something based on personal ideologies?\n* Do they approve posts incorrectly removed by the automoderator?\n* Do they remove posts that break the subreddit rules?\n* Do they participate in discussions with other mods or the community? How often do they perform the aforementioned moderator duties? Daily? Weekly? Not for some time?\n* Have they ever started a discussion on the subreddit rules? Should they have?\n* Have they ever attempted to tame the wild beast that is the automoderator? Do they have the skills to do that? Should they have?\n* Are they transparent about their reasons for removing a post when asked?\n* Have they ever moderated posts in which they have a clear conflict of interest? Is their primary focus on Ethereum, or something else? (Day job, traditional world, banks, other blockchains, etc.) Does this have a real effect on their role in Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem or their responsibilities as a moderator of /r/ethereum?\n\n# Roles & Responsibilities of Participants\n\nEach person who contributes to /r/ethereum should aim to add value to the discussion and to the larger Ethereum community, in good faith, and as described above under \u201cRole of /r/ethereum in the ecosystem\u201d.\n\nEach person is responsible for what /r/ethereum is today and what it becomes tomorrow. Some tangible \u201cdo\u2019s\u201d and \u201cdo not\u2019s\u201d for participants are outlined below. However, the scope of these is quite limited compared to what is described in the \u201cRole of /r/ethereum in the ecosystem\u201d section above. Therefore, it is the responsibility of each participant to take their own life experiences, perceptions, skills, knowledge, opinions, and understanding to add value to /r/ethereum to the best of their ability.\n\n## Making the Best of /r/ethereum\n\n**Aim for positivity.** Discuss in good-faith and assume others are discussing in good-faith as well. Be welcoming, inclusive, and encouraging. Practice patience, respect, and empathy. Engage in healthy debate, civil discourse, and critical discussions. Focus on the post, not the poster, during disagreements.\n\n**Upvote and downvote things.** This built-in moderation tool is exceptionally powerful. Keep in mind, upvotes/downvotes are not for voicing agreement/disagreement. When a post or comment contributes or adds value, even if one personally disagrees, it should be upvoted. When a post or comment does not contribute, nor add value, or the post or comment is off-topic, downvote it.\n\n**Use the report button.** Posts or comments that violate the subreddit rules can, and should, be reported. This brings it to the moderator\u2019s attention more quickly. When reporting, please provide as much detail as possible to help moderators more quickly evaluate each item in the moderation queue. Lastly, please don\u2019t report posts or comments out of disagreement, only about things that actually break the rules.\n\n**Stay on topic.** Discussions about other cryptocurrencies and related technologies are welcome, but if the topic is already being extensively covered by other threads, it is kindly recommended to post it to a more specific subreddit. There is an extensive (but not comprehensive) list of Ethereum-related Subreddits on the [\"All Ethereum\" Multireddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/all_ethereum/m/all_ethereum/).\n\n## Follow the Subreddit Rules\n\n**No inappropriate behavior.** This includes, but is not limited to: personal insults, threats of violence, slurs of any kind, posting people's private information.\n\n**Avoid speculation, price, market, and mining discussions.** Discussion related to the price of ether, buying, trading, market speculation, or any other price/market talk should be posted on /r/ethtrader, a third-party Subreddit not moderated by us. In addition, keep mining discussion to subreddits such as /r/EtherMining.\n\n**No spamming, scamming, drive-by posting, duplicate posts, misleading titles, or blogspam.**\n\n* Don\u2019t spam a single blog, project, company, or ICO. Posts should come from a variety of sources, cover different topics, and the poster should engage in discussions on their posts.\n* Don\u2019t attempt to scam people, link to phishing websites, or promote malicious applications.\n* Don\u2019t be that person who runs into the community, dumps a link to something, and then disappears immediately.\n* Check [https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/new/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/new/) to avoid posting something that is already being discussed. Instead, add to the ongoing conversation.\n* Avoid titles that do not accurately reflect the content of the post or are written to stimulate clicks.\n* Avoid linking to sites that lightly rewrite content in order to drive traffic to their site and generate ad revenue.\n\n**No using multiple accounts. No posting from brand new accounts.** Creating multiple accounts to get around rules is not allowed and will likely result in a permanent ban. Additionally, posts should be made from accounts at least 10 days old with a minimum of 20 comment karma. This is to keep trolls and spam-bots to a minimum. Exceptions may be made on a discretionary basis and one can [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/ethereum) if one feels their post adds value but they don\u2019t have the necessary account age/karma.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWe invite feedback from the community on the above guideline and encourage discussion on the topics herein. r/ethereum is a place for discussing Ethereum as a technology and a movement. Our focus is on maintaining the discourse in a productive and respectful direction.\n\nAll the best,\n\nr/ethereum mods", "What a bad article.\n\n> However, in spite of its massive market cap, Monero failed to outrank the mighty popularity of Bitcoin.\n\nDid anyone expect that?

We do believe that more downside will ensue and that the current bear market has yet to reach its low.\n\nThis is why we will still be employing our DCA strategy as more downside continues. We will, of course, buy $BTC below 3k. The prospects of buying $BTC at prices sub 3k could become a generational opportunity in the coming years.\n\nOur current sentiment leads us to believe that support at $3k will be beaten. We will be buyers in the $2600-$2900 region. This is the zone just under the trough of the sell-off caused by the China FUD from September 2017 (see chart below).\n\nWe will keep you posted as price action develops in the coming days.", "me: *inhales*\nFNDM: Yeah, we already know, you love Adam Taurus, he was \"wasted potential\", and you're sad he died. https://t.co/f1ZkH4PYJ9", "CryptoSlate: .BrendanBlumer, one of the executives behind #EOS, criticized #Bitcoins slow transaction times, low t https://t.co/bNHoNwB6am", "\"Hackers hid #malware in a fake #cryptotrading #app to steal your #cryptocurrency\" - It's sad that we have to say i https://t.co/SA28xTYWGV", "RT @sdgnigeria: WHO: RT DrTedros: It is with a heavy heart and enormous sadness that MoetiTshidi and I have arrived in #Cameroon to share t", "You will never regret that you found information about this project here.

This is the 3rd or 4th time the price is taking a surge so lets get over all the flawed arguments once and for all.\n\n> 1) Bitcoin has no intrinsic value\n\nNothing has intrinsic value. Value is a matter of association. Gold has value because of its properties, just like that, bitcoin has value because of its properties.\n\n> 2) Bitcoin is slow and expensive\n\nBitcoin is opensource protocol and is always improving. Transaction fees are not very high these days but thats a price you pay for censorship resistant transactions compared to traditional banking like paypal. But don't worry, bitcoin's 2nd layer, Lightning Network is getting popular with practically 0 fees and instant transactions. Speaking from experience, Lightning Network actually works. Its not as easy to use but so wasn't the internet when it was new.\n\n> 3) Its used by criminals\n\nThis is exactly what people used to say about the internet. The internet turn out pretty used because its open. Bitcoin is an open platform to develop on. Sure, people use technology for bad, that doesn't make the technology bad. Instead of limiting what people can do, we should be focusing on creating better people. Infact, one of the number one usecase of bitcoin is charity and tipping (see pineaple fund and people on this subreddit).\n\n> 4) Its trying solve a problem that doesn't exist\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto in [his first release](http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source) of bitcoin talked about the trust that traditional banking breaches. Financial colapses happen everywhere and people loose everything because someone at the banks messed up. Excess inflation, like in Venezuela and Argentina, make people loose everything they have and often commit suicide while people at the top get away. Sure, just like climate change, it doesn't seem real until it actually affects you.\n\nBut bitcoin is so much more. It has ignited so much in multiple sciences and economics. **Bitcoin is no more what it was in 2009** and with the advances in layer 2 solutions like Lightning Network, which is *like* the HTTP of money, its like saying \"the technology to stream stupid cat videos on demand will never be usefull\".\n\nWith a download of an app and 2 button clicks, you become a part of a global economy. Bitcoin is worlds first global currency.\n\nIts about choice. If you want to use your national currency, go ahead.\n\n> 5) Bitcoin wastes a lot of energy\n\nBitcoin uses energy for proof of work to **secure its network**. The reason bitcoin is so valuable is because its so secure (ill get to speculation). This energy is used to establish mathematical truth. There are other alternatives to Proof of Work like Proof of Stake which uses a lot less energy. Layer 1 of Bitcoin uses Proof of Work as of now.\n\n> 6) There are other better cryptocurrecies than bitcoin\n\nThere is no other network as **secure** and robust as bitcoin.\n\n> 7) Bitcoins price is very volatile\n\nAs of today, yes. But its been observed that since its beginning bitcoin's volatility is gradually decreasing. Its often said that each consecutive bull run is less volatile than before (there has been 2-3 bull runs).\n\n> 8) Wasn't bitcoin dead?\n\n[bitcoin obituaries](https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin-obituaries/). Bitcoin will never die. Even if price falls to 0 (which it won't cause people **value** freedom), the network will never die. [also this obituary song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hlN2nel5HI).\n\n> 9) Bitcoin is a bubble\n\nBitcoins all time lows has always been orders higher than its prior all time highs.\n\nLocal bubbles exists. There are no global bubbles. Its only going up. (no guarentee, don't kill me if you lose you money. Understand before buying/earning)\n\n> 10) Bitcoin is open souce code so it can be just copy pasted so it has no value\n\nBitcoins code can be replicated. Not the network. Its the network thats real.\n\n> 11) Bitcoin is centralised\n\nA lot of big miners are mining pools. Sometime in 2013 (not sure) poeple realised one mining pool was about to cross 50% of hash power which made a lot of people to opt-out of that mining pool and it reduced its hash power a lot. I should also tell you that people often overestimate the dangers of centralisation. A centralised miner can only change the next block. Not the entire blockchain. Though bitcoin has never been successfully attacked with 51% attack.\n\nSo no, its not centralised, but not 100% idealy decentralised either. Practically, its decentralised.\n\n> 12) Bitcoin mining is making all my gaming GPUs expensive and I'm sad  >:(\n\nNo one uses GPUs for bitcoin mining (as of now), GPUs are for other cryptocurrencies. Though I should tell you computation is going to be very valuable. Mostly because of AI, big data, crypto and gaming. Which means greater demand. That doesn't mean better cheaper GPUs won't come.\n\n> 13) 5000$ per bitcoin is very expensive so how could people do transaction below 5000$\n\nBitcoin is divisible. The smallest transaction I've done is 0.01 satoshi which is 0.0000000001 bitcoin = 0.0000005278$ as of today.\n\n\nAll this not focusing about what bitcoin actually is. If you're here and are a noob.

I think you mean you care about your \"stakeholders\".\n\n>\"Even if we love Ethereum and it was the community that we originated from, we are also looking into Polkadot\"\n\nIn other words, you think it makes sense to join forces with a private permissioned version of the Ethereum ecosystem to hedge your bets against the community that funded your project and made you all filthy rich. That's some fantastic loyalty and integrity right there. What could possibly go wrong by trying to get rich a second time by betraying your base?\n\nAragon's Polkadot play won't actually make \"decentralized organizations widespread\". That's just more inauthentic messaging. Parity's Web3 umbrella will be controlled by a very narrow group of stakeholders with DOT tokens (basically, Gavin Wood and his backers). That renders all inter-blockchain communication dependent on a plutocratic oligarchy. Public blockchains will become increasing centralized through this mechanism as more people use the underlying root chain for coordination. Organizations based on this kind of infrastructure will become vulnerable to all manner of meddling and disruption by the all-powerful DOT-holders. That's not the kind of infrastructure the public will have any legitimate reason to support. Thus, the organizations built atop this infrastructure will never become widespread.\n\n>\"CEO at Aragon One\"\n\nNeed I say more? This is literally an oxymoron.\n\n>\"I am writing this because I deeply care about Ethereum. Also because Aragon holds \\~0.25% of all ETH. I also hold ETH personally. So I\u2019d love for Ethereum to work out #tribalism\"\n\nI have yet to see evidence of that. I think you mean you \"deeply care\" about the riches that were carelessly dropped into your coffers. Also, having a sense of community or loyalty to a cause isn't \"tribalism\". It would be great if you and others stopped abusing this derogatory term to rationalize your own infidelities.\n\n>\"It\u2019s clear that developers are the end user of Ethereum\".\n\nIt's not \"clear\" at all. It's actually false. Developers take advantage of Ethereum in order to reach the end users. It's not complicated. If we expect Ethereum to amount to more than a shallow private club for coders then it needs to serve the interests of the wider public. If you expect any kind of adoption of this technology, then you must target the users first and foremost. The developers are the means to that end. So, you've got it entirely backwards.\n\n>\"the users wouldn\u2019t even notice they are using Ethereum\"\n\nThat's the very same line of thought that led people to start using Facebook and other walled gardens. Fooling people with a friendly and convenient UX doesn't legitimize your underlying tech stack, end-user license agreement, and so on. Enough with these deceptive practices.\n\n>\"The original plan (as heard from Ethereum cofounders) was to migrate the Ethereum Foundation funds into a DAO once the technology was ready. Now it is ready, so I propose that it\u2019s time to do so.\"\n\nThe original plan never identified the governance structure of this DAO. The reason it hasn't happened to this point isn't because of a lack of desire, but because the technology, and the community itself (by which I mean everyone with an interest in Ethereum, not just devs!), are still too immature and inexperienced to produce a viable and legitimate system.\n\nClaiming the Ethereum community is suddenly ready because Aragon has played around with a few corporate toy models is a joke of epic proportions, honestly. Aragon might know how to hack a few things together, but I highly doubt they understand good governance. Good governance in a \"public organization\" context isn't a product. It's a philosophy; or principle-based ideology for decision-making. The technology merely tries to embody this underlying logic. If you have a bad philosophy, you'll end up with bad governance and bad technology. Aragon has a terrible philosophy. In my opinion, it's selfish, corporate capitalism gone wild. Ergo, their approach to governance and technology will be similarly terrible. They admit as much when they say:\n\n>\"we certainly don\u2019t know what\u2019s the best governance mechanism for something like Ethereum\"\n\nAnd yet, they go on to attack the current informal governance process, proposing a \"committee system\" in its place. What's this committee system, you ask? Good question! Supposedly, it'll just be \"how it works today in a transparent manner\". Bullshit, I'm sorry. What Aragon has in mind here is formalized coin voting and little else. They haven't developed any real software to account for people's legitimate reasoning and democratic concerns, which is the only thing saving the current governance process from complete failure and tyranny!\n\nTo be very clear, our ability to voice our concerns and to actually be heard by the community at large, regardless of our perceived \"stake\" and \"status\", is what makes Ethereum governance different from other networks. It's the one saving grace keeping us in a somewhat respectable state. Sacrificing that democratic hope so that the entrenched inner circle of early adopters (the \"stakeholders\") can rule us more effectively is one of the most horrifying mistakes I can imagine.\n\nTLDR; Aragon is a deceptive untrustworthy corporate entity. They're merely using this EthDAO proposal to market their own broken philosophy and broken technology to the rest of us.", "The fast, accurate and low latency trading engine with flexible scalability can handle up to 2,000,000 orders per s https://t.co/Pe7YPWCxbG", "RT @TheRipplerIAm: They are dumping XRP, they just tripled their OTC sales and the market slumped like a whipped dick.

We shouldn't scale the blockchain until the network is ready for mass adoption. It's not ready yet. All the proposals to bring on mass adoption right now involve getting everyone to run a wallet on their phone, not a node in their home. This means that a comparatively small number of full nodes would be securing the network for all the phone wallets. This is an enormous security compromise with potentially catastrophic effects for the whole network. Phone wallets need to be connected to a secure and large network of economically relevant full nodes. We need to keep the ratio of full nodes to phone wallets high -- that's the real scaling: scaling up the ratio of full nodes to phone wallets. We should not try to scale up the size of the blockchain until we scale up the number of full nodes.\n\n> Since we can see that people are becoming enthusiastic again about Bitcoin, discussing this thing is of utmost importance.\n\nNo one is opposed to increasing the blocksize when the network is large enough for a capacity increase. But it's not. Those who want to scale now don't seem to realize the dangers of putting everyone on a phone wallet. Phone wallets do not validate the rules of the bitcoin network, they merely hold private keys. Instead of validating the rules, they trust third parties to validate the rules, keep them connected to the network, and give them valid information about what transactions have been sent to the user's wallet. Usually, these third parties are either the wallet maker (who runs a full node that all of his users' wallets are connected to), the electrum network (which is currently under a denial of service attack because it is a weak point in the network), or the miners (in the case of SPV wallets).\n\nAll of these methods of running phone wallets are open to a variety of attacks. Remember when the majority of the miners wanted to break off and form a separate network (segwit2x)? That is just one demonstration of the insecurity of SPV wallets, which trust miners to give them valid information. Relying on the electrum network is also increasingly difficult because of denial of service attacks and the sybil problem. DoS attacks on electrum servers are designed to overload the cpus of the volunteers who run electrum servers with requests for information. The result is that \"real\" users have a hard time finding a server that can actually give them information. There's also a high prevalence of scam servers which refuse to relay transactions but merely tell you to visit scam sites and download a coin-stealing malware. Since it is easy to set up an electrum server, many scammers are doing so, which is a quintessential sybil problem. Then there's the option of just using a wallet that connects to the wallet maker's node. This is the most common type of wallet, and it's insecure because the node operator for that batch of wallet users then controls what network his users are on and what rules he's validating. A wallet operator who controls his users' connection can feed them false data or censor their transactions.\n\nAll of the above reasons are why our scaling priority needs to be: help more people run full nodes. That's the only way to give the network a secure foundation for the future. Getting everyone to run phone wallets is not a scaling solution, instead it creates a massive scaling problems and security vulnerabilities. A big reason for keeping the block size low right now is because the network is not ready to scale and won't be until running a full node is easy enough that there's a high ratio of full node operators to phone wallet users.", "Found out why volume is low", "ARDR/BTC 2 Month Low - Ardor (ARDR) price reaches 2 Month Low - $ARDR $BTC #ardor #fintech #cryptocurrency", "Is circulating supply too high on mc then?
